It starts in my toes 
And I crinkle my nose 
Wherever it goes I always know 
That you make me smile 
Please stay for a while now 
Just take your time 
Wherever you go 
The rain is falling on my window pane 
But we are hiding in a safer place 
Under the covers staying safe and warm 
You give me feelings that I adore 
They start in my toes 
Make me crinkle my nose 
Wherever it goes 
I always know 
That you make me smile 
Please stay for a while now

Just take your time 
Wherever you go 
I've been asleep for a while now 
You tucked me in just like a child now 
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms 
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth 
It starts in my soul 
And I lose all control 
When you kiss my nose 
The feeling shows 
Cause you make me smile 
Baby just take your time now 
Holding me tight 
Wherever, wherever, where ever you go 
Wherever, wherever, where ever you go 
Lady - you bring me up when I'm down, 
Maybe you're gonna change my life around. 
  
You came to me when I was lonely and no one cared. 
You made me see that I was only just runnin' scared. 
I saw your face and somethin' told me you were the one. 
You smiled at me and now I see My life's begun. 
  
Lady - you brought me in from out the rain, 
Maybe me life will never be the same. 
  
Once I was filled with desperation - a solitary man 
You gave me hope and inspiration like only true love can. 
Now I believe in what you're sayin' - I'm ten feet tall. 
This love don't need no explainin' - we've got it all. 
  
Lady - you bring me up when I'm down,
Lady - you bring me up when I'm down,

Sometimes you're crazy then you wonder why 
I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry 
But there's nothing I can do 
I've been looking for a girl like you
You look at me, you got nothing left to say 
I'm gonna pout at you until I get my way 
I won't dance, you won't sing 
I just wanna love you but you wanna wear my ring 
But there's nothing I can do 

I only wanna be with you 
You can call me a fool 
I only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan 
Sitting on a fence 
I said, "That line is great" you asked me what it meant by 
I Said I shot a man named Gray 
Took his wife to Italy 
She inherited a million bucks, and when she died it came to me 
I can't help it if I'm lucky 

I only wanna be with you 
Ain't Bobby so cool 
I only wanna be with you

Yeah I'm tangled up in blue 
I only wanna be with you 
You can call me a fool 
Only wanna be with you
Sometimes I wonder if we'll ever end 
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends 
Sometimes you're crazy then you wonder why 
I'm such a baby, yeah, the Dolphins make me cry 
But there's nothing I can do 

I only wanna be with you 
You can call me a fool 
I only wanna be with you

How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake

Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I keep crying baby please

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Hey!.
You can take all the tea in china
Put it in a big brown bag for me
Sail right around the seven oceans
Drop it straight into the deep blue sea
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey from the bee

You cant stop us on the road to freedom
You cant keep us cause our eyes can see
Men with insight, men in granite
Knights in armor bent on chivalry
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey from the bee

She's alright, shes alright (she's an angel)

Sail it right around the seven oceans
Drop it smack dab in the middle of the deep blue sea
Because shes as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey from the bee

She's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like the honey, baby, from the bee
Shes my baby, you know she's alright.
Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could have
And maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best girl I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind you were always on my mind

And maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely lonely times
I guess I never told you I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind you were always on my mind

Tell me tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
And give me give me one more chance to keep you satisfied i'll keep you satisfied

If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try

Take a chance on me
(That's all I ask of you honey)
Take a chance on me

We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're together
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better
Cause you know I've got
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you
It's magic
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair
But I think you know
That I can't let go

If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around

Take a chance on me
Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game 
On this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame 
Turning and returning to some secret place inside 
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say 

Take my breath away 
Take my breath away 

Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love 
Never hesitating to become the fated ones 
Turning and returning to some secret place to hide 
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say 

Take my breath away 

Through the hourglass I saw you, in time you slipped away 
When the mirror crashed I called you, and turned to hear you say 
If only for today I am unafraid 

Take my breath away 
Take my breath away 

Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game 
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames 
Turning and returning to some secret place inside 
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say 

Take my breath away 
My love, take my breath away 
I love myself I want you to love me
When I feel down I want you above me
I search myself I want you to find me
I forget myself I want you to remind me

I dont want anybody else
When I think about you I touch myself
Oh I dont want anybody else oh no, oh no, oh no

Youre the one who makes me come running
Youre the sun who makes me shine
When youre around Im always laughing
I want to make you mine

I close my eyes and see you before me
Think I would die if you were to ignore me
A fool could see just how much I adore you
I'd get down on my knees I do anything for you

I dont want anybody else
When I think about you I touch myself
Ooh I dont want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no

I want you I dont want anybody else
And when I think about you I touch myself
Oh, oh, oh, oh ah

I dont want anybody else when I think about you
I touch myself ooh I dont want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no
When the truth is found to be lies
And all the joys within you dies
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love

When the garden flowers baby are dead yes
And your mind is full of red
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love

Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his
But in your head baby I'm afraid you don't know where it is
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love

Tears are running ah running down your breast
And your friends baby they treat you like a guest
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love
Oh, why you look so sad?
Tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don't be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
Cause I've seen the dark side too
When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

So if you're mad, get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey, what you got to hide?
I get angry too
Well I'm a lot like you
When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
'cause even if you're wrong

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you

And when...
When the night falls on you, baby
You're feeling all alone
You won't be on your own

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you

I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Clock strikes upon the hour 
And the sun begins to fade 
Still enough time to figure out 
How to chase my blues away 
I've done alright up 'til now 
It's the light of day that shows me how 
And when the night falls, loneliness calls 

Oh I wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah Wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Oh I wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah Wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 

I've been in love and lost my senses 
Spinning through the town 
Soon or later the fever ends 
And I wind up feeling down 
I need a man who'll take a chance 
On a love that burns hot enough to last 
So when the night falls 
My lonely heart falls 

Oh I wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah Wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Oh I wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat 
Yeah Wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Somebody who loves me 
 
To hold me in his arms 
I need a man who'll take a chance 
On a love that burns hot enough to last 
So when the night falls 
My lonely heart falls
Oh I can't keep it in,
I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out.
I've got to show the world, world's got to see,
see all the love love that's in me.
I said, why walk alone,
Why worry when it's warm over here.
You've got so much to say, say what you mean,
mean what you're thinking, and think anything.
Oh why, why must you waste you're life away,
you've got to live for today, then let it go
Oh, lover, I want to spend this time with you,
there's nothing I wouldn't do, If you let me know.
And I can't keep it in,
I can't hide it and I can't lock it away.
I'm up for your love, love heats my blood,
blood spins my head, and my head falls in love, oh.

No, I can't keep it in,
I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out.
I've gotta show the world, world's got to know,
know of the love, love that lies low, so
Why can't you say,
If you know, then why can't you say.
You've got too much deceit, deceit kills the light,
light needs to shine, I said shine light , shine light.
Love, That's no way to live your life,
you allow too much to go by, and that won't do.
No, lover. I want to have you here by my side
Now don't you run, don't you hide, while I'm with you.
And I can't keep it in,
I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out.
I've got to show the world, world's got to see,
see all the love love that's in me.
I said, why walk alone,
why worry when it's warm over here.
You've got so much to say, say what you mean,
Mean what you're thinking, and think anything. Why not?
Now why why why not?
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
Look into my eyes - you will see,
What you mean to me.
Search your heart - search your soul,
And when you find me there, you'll search no more.

Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for.
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for.
You know it's true,
Everything I do - I do it for you.

Look into your heart - you will find,
There's nothin' there to hide.
Take me as I am - take my life,
I would give it all - I would sacrifice.

Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for.
I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more.
Yea know it's true,
Everything I do - I do it for you.

There's no love - like your love.
And no other - could give more love.
There's nowhere - unless you're there.
All the time - all the way.

Oh - you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for.
I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more,
Yeah, I would fight for you - I'd lie for you.
Walk the wire for you - yeah, I'd die for you.

Yea know it's true.
Everything I do. Oh, I do it for you.
You know our love was meant to be
the kind of love that lasts forever
And I want you here with me 
from tonight until the end of time
You should know, everywhere I go
Always on my mind, in my heart
in my soul,baby

You're the meaning in my life
you're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
you're the inspiration
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me saying
No one needs you more than I need you

And I know, yes I know that it's plain to see
So in love when we're together.
Now I know that I need you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know, everywhere I go
Always on my mind you're in my heart in my soul

You're the meaning in my life

You're the meaning in my life
you're the inspiration.
You bring feeling to my life
you're the inspiration.
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me saying
No one needs you more than I need you
When you love somebody 'til the end of time

When you love somebody, always on my mind

No one needs you more than I need you
I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice
And it dont count for much
But Im not letting go
I believe theres still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and Ill show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me

You know you cant fool me
Ive been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on

Lost in love and I dont know much
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch? 
But Im back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and Ill show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me

You know you cant fool me
Ive been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on

You know you cant fool me
Ive been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on
I'm glad you're home
Now did you really miss me
I guess you did by the look in your eyes
Well lay back and relax while I put away the dishes
Then you and me can rock-a-bye

You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell
You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell
You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell
You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell

The night is young and full of possibilities
Well come on and let yourself be free
My love for you, so long than I've been saving
Tonight was made for me and you

Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind

Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey when you knocked on my door
I gave you my key

Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart

So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

And nobody told us
Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
I think we can make it

So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
You put the sparks to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights
I hear the clock, it's six a.m.
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs and my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you.
I break the yolks, make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
I wipe the spots off the mirror
Don't leave the keys in the door
Never put wet towels on the floor anymore' cause
Dreams last for so long
even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon you will see

You were meant for me
And I was meant for you.

I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up a paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy and I was sad
It made me miss you oh so bad 'cause
Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon you will see

You were meant for me
And I was meant for you.

I go about my business, I'm doin fine
Besides what would I say if I had you on the line
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken, everyday.
I brush my teeth and put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up. Turn the sheets down.
Take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pjs and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll be all right
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause
Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon I know you will see

You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

Yeah. 

You were meant for me and I was meant for you.
If we still have time, we might still get by
Every time I think about it, I wanna cry
With bombs and the devil, and the kids keep comin'
No way to breathe easy, no time to be young

But I tell myself that I was doin' all right
There's nothin' left to do at night
But to go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

My love is the evenin' breeze touchin' your skin
The gentle, sweet singin' of leaves in the wind
The whisper that calls after you in the night
And kisses your ear in the early moonlight
And you don't need to wonder, you're doing fine
My love, the pleasure's mine

Let me go crazy on ya
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, ohhh

Wild man's world is cryin' in pain
What you gonna do when everybody's insane
So afraid of one who's so afraid of you
What you gonna do...ohhh...

Oh.  Crazy on ya
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

I was a willow last night in my dream
I bent down over a clear running stream
Sang you the song that I heard up above
And you kept me alive with your sweet flowing love

Crazy
Yeah, crazy on ya
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
Crazy on ya
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, yea
When it's love you give 
(I'll be a man of good faith.) 
then in love you live. 
(I'll make a stand. I won't break.) 
I'll be the rock you can build on, 
be there when you're old, 
to have and to hold. 
When there's love inside 
(I swear I'll always be strong.) 
then there's a reason why. 
(I'll prove to you we belong.) 
I'll be the one that protects you 
from the wind and the rain, 
from the hurt and pain. 

Let's make it all for one and all for love. 
Let the one you hold be the one you want, 
the one you need, 
'cause when it's all for one it's one for all.
When there's someone that should know 
then just let your feelings show 
and make it all for one and all for love. 

When it's love you make 
(I'll be the fire in your night.) 
then it's love you take. 
(I will defend, I will fight.) 
I'll be there when you need me. 
When honor's at stake, 
this vow I will make: 
that it's all for one and all for love. 
You're a song
Written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong
Cause this might sound
To you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts
Go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things
I deserve
For being such
A good girl honey

Cause of you
I forgot the
Smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of
Reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong
To each other

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things
I deserve
For being such
A good girl honey

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things
I deserve
For being such a good girl, for being such aaah

I love you more than all
That's on the planet
Movin' talkin' walkin' breathin'
You know it's true
Oh baby it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things
I deserve
For being such
A good girl honey

Underneath your clothes
Wah-oh oh oh oh
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things
I deserve
For being such
A good girl
For being such
A good girl
I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me,
and I don't see an easy way out of this
Her diary, it sits on the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cat's in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said,
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away.

Is there any just cause for feeling like this
On the surface I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again.
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake.
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times.

It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over, the moment is gone
I followed my hands, not my head,
I know I was wrong.

No more timing each tear that falls from my eyes
I'm not hiding the remedy to cure this old heart of mine

I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

Moving sidewalks, I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from down here below where the streets see
me lonely for you.

I can dream about you
I'm gonna press my lips against you and hold you tight to me
I can dream about you
You know you got me spellbound what else can it be

Moving sidewalks, I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from the pain in my heart 'cause it's you that I need.

I don't understand it
I can't keep my mind off loving you
Oh, now baby, I'm caught up in the magic I see in you
There's one thing to do
In your arms I can still feel the way you
Want me when you hold me
I can still hear the words you whispered
When you told me
I can stay right here forever in your arms

And there ain't no way
I'm lettin' you go now
And there ain't no way
And there ain't not how
I'll never see that day.

'Cause I'm keeping you
Forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every
Morning to your sweet face--always

Mmmm, baby
In your heart  I can still hear
A beat for every time you kiss me
And when we're apart,
I know how much you miss me
I can feel your love for me in your heart

And there ain't no way
I'm lettin' you go now
And there ain't now way
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day.

'Cause I'm keeping you
Forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every
Morning to your sweet face--always

In your eyes
(I can still see the look of the one) 
I can still see the look of the one who really loves me
(I can still feel the way that you want)
The one who wouldn't put anything else in the world above me
(I can still see love for me) 
I can still see love for me in your eyes
(I still see the love)

And there ain't no way
I'm lettin' you go now
And there ain't no way
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day.

'Cause I'm keeping you
Forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every
Morning to your sweet face  always

'Cause I'm keeping you
Forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every
Morning to your sweet face  always

I'm keeping you forever and for always
I'm in your arms
If I could grant 
You one wish 
I'd wish you could see the way you kiss 
Ooh, I love watching you Baby 
When you're driving me crazy 

Ooh, I love the way you 
Love the way you love me 
There's nowhere else I'd rather be 
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me 
I only wish that you could see the way you love me 
The way you love 

It's not right 
It's not fair 
What you're missing over there 
Someday I'll find a way to show you 
Just how lucky I am to know you 

Ooh, I love the way you 
Love the way you love me 
There's nowhere else I'd rather be 
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me 
I only wish that you could see the way you love me 
The way you love me 

You're the million reasons why 
There's love reflecting in my eyes 

Ooh, I love the way you 
Love the way you love me 
There's nowhere else I'd rather be 
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me 
I only wish that you could see the way you love me 
The way you love me 
The way you love me 

Ooh, the way you love me 
The way you love me 
So I find a reason to shave my legs 
Each single morning 
So I count on someone on 
Friday nights to take me dancing
And then to church on Sundays 
To plant more dreams
And someday think of kids 
Or maybe just to save a little money

You're the one I need 
The way back home is always long 
But if you're close to me I'm holding on 
You're the one I need 
My real life has just begun 
Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun 

In the world full of strangers 
You're the one I know

So I learned to cook 
and finally lose my kitchen phobia 
So I've got the arms to cuddle in 
When there's a ghost or a muse 
That brings insomnia
To buy more thongs 
And write more happy songs 
It always takes a little help from someone

You're the one I need 
You're the one I need 
With you my real life has just begun

You're the one I need 
You're the one I need 

Nothing like your smile made of sun 

Nothing like your love
Nothing like your love
Nothing like your love
Always and forever 
Each moment with you 
Is just like a dream to me 
That somehow came true
And I know tomorrow 
Will still be the same 
Cause we've got a life of love 
That won't ever change and.
Every day 
Love me your own special way 
Melt all my heart away 
With a smile
Take time to tell me 
You really care 
And we'll share tomorrow together 
I'll always love you forever
There'll always be sunshine 
When I look at you 
It's something I can't explain 
Just the things that you do
And if you get lonely 
Phone me and take 
A second to give to me 
That magic you make and.. 
Every day 
Love me your own special way 
Melt all my heart away 
With a smile
Take time to tell me 
You really care 
And we'll share tomorrow together 
I'll always love you forever
You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in the holy church
You could say I lost my sense of direction
You could say all of this and worse but

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You could say I'd lost my belief in our politicians
They all seemed like game show hosts to me

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes I see your face

I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse but
Let me say this first

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do
I'm in love with you girl cause you're on my mind,
you're the one I think about most every time.
And when you pack a smile in everything you do,
don't you understand, girl, this love is true.
You're soft, succulent so sweet and thin
that's kind of like a vision upon your skin.
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true.
Together we're one separated we're two.
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire.
'Cause you contain a quality, you that I admire.
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world so try tounderstand.
I'm in love girl,
I'm in so love girl.
I'm just in love girl, and this is true.

Girl, you know it's true.
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh I love you.
Yes, you know it's true.
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh I love you.
Girl, you know it's true.
My love is for you.
Girl, you know it's true.
My love is for you.

This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain,
my emotions starts up when I hear your name.
Maybe your sweet sweet voice would ring in my ear,
then delay my system when you are near.
Come with your positive emotion, love, making enjoyin'
that's for me to bust it's like a girl and a boy.
These feelings I get I often wonder why,
so I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I.
Now what you're wearing I don't care, as I've said before,
no reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are.
If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world so try tounderstand.
I'm in love girl,
I'm in so love girl.
I'm just in love girl, and this is true.

Girl, you know it's true.
Oh, Oh, Oh I love you.
Yes, you know it's true.
Oh, Oh, Oh I love you.

Girl, you know it's true.
My love is for you.
Girl, you know it's true.
My love

Girl, you know it's true.
Oh, Oh, Oh I love you.
Yes, you know it's true.
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh I love you.
Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance
Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

Kiss me out of the bearded barley.
Lightly, beside the green, green grass.
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step.
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress.
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight.
Lead me out on the moonlit floor.
Lift your open hand.
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance,
silver moon's sparkling.
So kiss me.
Kiss me down by the broken tree house.
Swing me high upon its hanging tire.
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat.
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map.
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight.
Lead me out on the moonlit floor.
Lift your open hand.
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance,
silver moon's sparkling.
So kiss me.
Kiss me beneath the milky twilight.
Lead me out on the moonlit floor.
Lift your open hand.
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance,
silver moon's sparkling.
So kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss me
Never knew I could feel like this
Like I've never seen the sky before
I want to vanish inside your kiss
Every day I'm loving you more and more
Listen to my heart, can you hear it sings
Telling me to give you everything
Seasons may change, winter to spring
But I love you until the end of time

Come what may
Come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life doesnt't seem such a waste
It all revolves around you
And there's no mountain too high
No river too wide
Sing out this song I'll be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather
And stars may collide
But I love you until the end of time

Come what may
Come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Oh, come what may, come what may
I will love you, I will love you
Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place

Come what may
Come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Some people live for the fortune 
Some people live just for the fame 
Some people live for the power yeah 
Some people live just to play the game 
Some people think that the physical things 
Define what's within 
And I've been there before 
But that life's a bore 
So full of the superficial 

Some people want it all 
But I don't want nothing at all 
If it ain't you baby 
If I ain't got you baby 
Some people want diamond rings 
Some just want everything 
But everything means nothing 
If I Ain't Got You 

Some people search for a fountain 
that Promises forever young 
Some people need three dozen roses 
And that's the only way to prove you love them 

hand me the world on a silver platter 
And what good would it be 
No one to share, no one who truly cares for me 

Some people want it all 
But I don't want nothing at all 
If it ain't you baby 
If I ain't got you baby 
Some people want diamond rings 
Some just want everything 
But everything means nothing 
If I ain't got you 

Some people want it all 
But I don't want nothing at all 
If it ain't you baby 
If I ain't got you baby 
Some people want diamond rings 
Some just want everything 
But everything means nothing 
If I ain't got you 

Some people want it all 
But i don't want nothing at all 
If it ain't you baby 
If I ain't got you baby 
Some people want diamond rings 
Some just want everything 
But everything means nothing 
If i ain't got you 

If I ain't got you with me baby 
Nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing 
If I ain't got you with me baby 
When the sun beats down 
And burns the tar up on the roof 
And your shoes get so hot 
You wish your tired feet were fireproof

Under the boardwalk 
Down by the sea 
On a blanket with my baby 
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun 
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun 
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above 
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love 
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)

From the park you'll hear 
The happy sound of a carousel 
You can almost taste the hot dogs 
And french fries they sell

Under the boardwalk 
Down by the sea, yeah 
On a blanket with my baby 
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun 
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun 
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above 
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love 
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)

Oh, under the boardwalk 
Down by the sea 
On a blanket with my baby 
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun 
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun 
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above 
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling in love 
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)
I've been drivin' all night, my hand's wet on the wheel
There's a voice in my head, that drives my heel
It's my baby callin', says: I need you here
And it's half past four, and i'm shifting gear
When she's lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable comin' in from above
Don't need no phone at all

We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a wave in the air
Radar love

The radio's playing some forgotten song
Brenda lee's "coming on strong"
The road's got me hypnothised
And i'm speeding into a new sunrise
When I get lonely, and i'm sure i've had enough
She sends her comfort, comin' in from above
Don't need no letters at all
We've got a thing that's called a radar love
We've got a line in the sky

No more speed, i'm almost there
Gotta keep cool, now gotta take care
Last car to pass, here I go
And the line of cars drove down real slow
And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda lee's "coming on strong"
And the newsman sang his same old song
One more radar love's gone
When I get lonely, and i'm sure i've had enough
She sends her comfort, comin' in from above
Don't need no letters at all

We've got a thing that's called a radar love
We've got a line in the sky
We've got a thing that's called a radar love
We've got a thing that's called a radar love 
Every night in my dreams I see you ,I feel you,
That is how I know you go on.
Far across the distance 
And spaces between us 
You have come to show you go on
Near, far, wherever you are 
I believe that the heart does go on 
Once more you open the door 
And you're here in my heart 
And my heart will go on and on
Love can touch us one time 
And last for a lifetime 
And never let go till we're one
Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to 
In my life we'll always go on
Near, far, wherever you are 
I believe that the heart does go on 
Once more you open the door 
And you're here in my heart 
And my heart will go on and on
There is some love that will not go away
You're here, there's nothing I fear, 
And I know that my heart will go on 
We'll stay forever this way 
You are safe in my heart 
And my heart will go on and on
Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man
And didn't I give you everything
That a woman possibly can
Each time I tell myself I think I've had enough
Well I'm gonna show you baby that a woman can be tough
So come on, come on, come on and

Take it
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
I know you will
Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now baby
Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good

You're out on the street lookin' good
Baby deep down in your heart you know that it ain't right
No you'll never hear me cryin'
You know I cry all the time
Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
You hold me in your arms and I start singin' once again
So come on, come on, come on and

Take it
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
I know you will
Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now baby
Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good

Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
You hold me in your arms and I start singin' once again
So come on, come on, come on

Take it
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
I know you will
Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now baby
Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good
All through the night
Ill be awake and Ill be with you
All through the night
This precious time when time is new
Oh, all through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without saying

We have no past we wont reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end

All through the night
Stray cat is crying so stray cat sings back
All through the night
They have forgotten what by day they lack
Oh under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see

We have no past we wont reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end

Oh the sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there let me stay there awhile

We have no past we wont reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end
Run
Running all the time
Running to the future
With you right by my side

Me
Im the one you chose
Out of all the people
You wanted me the most
Im so sorry that Im falling
Help me up lets keep on running
Dont let me fall out of love

Running, running
As fast as we can
I really hope you make it
(do you think well make it? )
Were running
Keep holding my hand
Its so we dont get separated

Be
Be the one I need
Be the one I trust most
Dont stop inspiring me
Sometimes its hard to keep on running
We work so much to keep it going
Dont make me want to give up

Running, running
As fast as we can
I really hope you make it
(do you think well make it? )
Were running
Keep holding my hand
Its so we dont get separated

Running, running
As fast as we can
I really hope you make it
(do you think well make it? )
Were running
Keep holding my hand
Its so we dont get separated

Moving forward using all my breath
Making love to you was never second best
I saw the world thrashing all around your face
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace
I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference and
It's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(You should know better)
Dream of better lives the kind which never hate
(You should see why)
Dropped in the state of imaginary grace
(You should know better)
I made a pilgrimage to save this human race

Never comprehending a race that long gone by

I like
Where we are
When we drive
In your car
I like
Where we are
here

Cause our lips
Can touch
And our cheeks
Can brush
Our lips
Can touch
Here

When you are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I’ve missed you quite terribly."
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
That there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

I like
Where you sleep
When you sleep
Next to me
I like,
Where you sleep;
Here.

Our lips,
Can touch,
And our cheeks,
Can brush.
Cause our lips,
Can touch;
here

When you are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I've missed you quite terribly
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
That there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

Our lips
Can touch
Our lips
Can touch
here


You are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I’ve missed you quite terribly."
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
That there's no place else I could be but here in your


When you are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I’ve missed you quite terribly."
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly.
That there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

Here in your arms
Than here in your arms
The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now
As I look in your eyes
I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too
Much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love
Life is a moment in space,
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place.
I kiss the morning goodbye,
But down inside you know
We never know why.

The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong.
I turn away from the wall.
I stumble and fall,
But I give you it all.

I am a woman in love
And I'd do anything
To get you into my world,
And hold you within.
It's a right I defend
Over and over again.
What do I do?

With you eternally mine,
In love there is
No measure of time.
They planned it all at the start
That you and I, live
In each others heart.

We may be oceans away,
You feel my love
I hear what you say.
No truth is ever a lie.
I stumble and fall,
But I give you it all.

I am a woman in love
And I'd do anything
To get you into my world,
And hold you within.
It's a right I defend
Over and over again.
What do I do?

I am a woman in love
And I'm talkin' to you.
You know how you feel
What a woman can do.
It's a right I defend
Over and over again

I am a woman in love
And I'd do anything
To get you into my world,
And hold you within.
It's a right I defend
Over and over again.
What do I do?
I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

It's more than a feeling
When I hear that old song they used to play
I begin dreaming
'till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
as clear as the sun in the summer sky

It's more than a feeling
When I hear that old song they used to play
I begin dreaming
'till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
and dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away

It's more than a feeling
When I hear that old song they used to play
I begin dreaming
'till I see Marianne walk away
We're starting it over, we're making way for destiny
A time to turnover a better life for you and me
A new recreation to channel all this energy
Let's solove the equation, I need to feel, you close to me
So baby let your conscience go
There's no turning back when love takes hold
Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long

The more that I see you
The more I know that love belongs
With you in my mind boy
I wouldn't know what's right from wrong
Cause love will takeover
And leave you out of sight and mind
You've got to go with the feeling
And trust fate to be kind
And baby let your conscience go
There's no turning back when love takes hold
Hold me baby, drive me crazy

Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long
Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long

And baby let your conscience go
There's no turning back once love gets hold
Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long
You are an obsession, I cannot sleep
I am a possession unopened at your feet
There is no balance, no equality
Be still I will not accept defeat

I will have you, yes I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly, a wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you

You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me
You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me

I feed you, I drink you by day and by night
I need you, I need you by sun or candlelight
You protest, you want to leave 
You say there's no alternative

Your face appears again, I see the beauty there
But I see danger, stranger beware
A circumstance in your naked dreams
Your affection is not what it seems

You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me
You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me

My fantasy has turned to madness
All my goodness has turned to badness
My need to possess you has consumed my soul
My life is trembling, I have no control

I will have you, yes I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly, a wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you

You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me
You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me


There's a reason for the sunshiny sky
There's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the season when those love lights shine all around us
So let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love can't hide
And then go stealing through the moonlit night with your lover

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean it's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on the wind
And let your love find you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean that's the reason

There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candle lights
Must be the season when those love lights shine all around us
So let that wonder take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face you can't hold back

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean it's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on the wind
And let your love find you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean that's the reason

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean it's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on the wind
And let your love find you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean that's the reason.\
Though it hurts to go away, it’s impossible to stay
But there’s one thing I must say before I go
I love you (I love you), you know
I’ll be thinkin’ of you in most everything I do

Now the time is movin’ on and I really should be gone
But you keep me hangin’ on for one more smile
I love you (I love you) all the while
With your cute little wave
Will you promise that you’ll save your

Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye bye, baby, bye bye
Don’t cry, honey, don’t cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I’ll soon be back for more

Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don’t you dare me to stay
‘Cause you know I’ll have to say

That I’ve got to work each day and that’s why I go away
But I count the seconds till I’m home with you
I love you (I love you), it’s true
You’re so cute honey, gee
Won’t you save them up for me? You

Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye bye, baby, bye bye
Don’t cry, honey, don’t cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I’ll soon be back for more

Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don’t you dare me to stay
‘Cause you know you’ve got to save your

Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye bye, baby, bye bye
Don’t cry, honey, don’t cry
Won’t you save them for me
Even though you’re only three?
When you love someone youll do anything
Youll do all the crazy things that you cant explain
Youll shoot the moon put out the sun
When you love someone

Youll deny the truth believe a lie
Therell be times that youll believe you can really fly
But your lonely nights have just begun
When you love someone

When you love someone you'll feel it deep inside
And nothin else can ever change your mind
When you want someone when you need someone
When you love someone

When you love someone you'll sacrifice
Youd give it everything you got and you wont think twice
Youd risk it all no matter what may come
When you love someone
Youll shoot the moon put out the sun
When you love someone
You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

It's not so much the things you say to me
It's not the things you do
It's how I feel each time you're close to me
That keeps me close to you, woh oh

You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

That always keeps me there, woh oh woh

You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

It's hard to tell you all the love I'm feeling
That's just not my style
You've got a way to send my senses reeling
Every time you smile, woh oh

You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

Of my heart
Oh oh of my heart

We slip and slide as we fall in love 
And I just can't seem to get enough of 

We walk together 
We're walking down the street 
And I just can't get enough 
And I just can't get enough 
Every time I think of you 
I know we have to meet 
And I just can't get enough 
I just can't get enough

Fantasy could never be so giving

Look in my heart and let love keep us together

I see the crystal raindrops fall
And see the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you some time
And I want to spend some time with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

We look for love, no time for tears
Wasted water is all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not to those who wait too late
We got to go for all we know

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
Darling, when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building big castles way on high
Just the two of us
You and I

Just the two of us
Let's get together, baby
Just the two of us
We can make it
Just the two of us
We can make it
Just the two of us

How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed someone to understand my ups and downs, there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby (yes I do)

How sweet it is to be loved by you (feel so fine)
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby (woah, yeah)

How sweet it is to be loved by you (it's just like sugar sometimes)
How sweet it is to be loved by you

(Woah, yeah)

You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby (woah, yes)

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you (woah, now)
How sweet it is to be loved by you (it's like jelly, baby, woah now)
How sweet it is to be loved by you (just like honey to the bee babe, yeah now)
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
All through my wandering years
I always said I was biding my time
But alone in the dark I'd face my fears
That no other heart would come to mine 

At first when you found me
It took me a while 'til I realized
Why I felt weak when you were around me
Why I couldn't speak when I looked in your eyes 

All this time I've been searching
Until you, I was lost in my dreams
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven
Watching over me 

Oh wherever you go
Invisible hands reach over the miles
For every wish you make to the stars
There's one silent kiss I send to the sky 

All this time I've been searching
Until you I was lost in my dreams
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven
Watching over me 

Everything has changed
Since you came my way
'Cause you put the color
In a world of grey
And you make the love
That carries me away 

All this time I've been searching
Until you I was lost in my dreams
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven
Watching over me
Feels like heaven
Watching over me 
I believe in miracles
Where you from
You sexy thing
I believe in miracles
Since you came along
You sexy thing

Miracles right before my eyes
You sexy thing got me hypnotised
Don't stop what ya' doing
What ya' doing to me
My angel from above lying next to me
How did ya' know that I'd be the one
Been a long time coming only just begun
Doing all the things that makes my heart sing
Keep doing what you're doing you sexy thing

How did ya' know I needed you so badly
How did ya' know I gave my heart gladly
Yesterday I was one of a lonely people
Now you're lying next to me
Making love to me

I believe in miracles
Where you from
You sexy thing
You sexy thing
I believe in miracles
Since you came along
You sexy thing

Only yesterday I was on my own
Just another day later my mind was blown
You sexy thing come into my life
Forever and a day it feels so right
How did ya' know that I'd be the one
Been a long time coming only just begun
Doing all the things that makes my heart sing
Keep doing what you're doing you sexy thing

How did ya' know I needed you so badly
How did ya' know I gave my heart gladly
Yesterday I was one of a lonely people
Now you're lying next to me
Making love to me

I believe in miracles
Where you from
You sexy thing
You sexy thing
I believe in miracles
Since you came along
You sexy thing

Kiss me baby
You sexy thing
You sexy thing

Touch me baby
You sexy thing
You sexy thing

Kiss me baby
You sexy thing
You sexy thing

Touch me baby
You sexy thing
You sexy thing

Kiss me baby
You sexy thing

Touch me baby
You sexy thing
You sexy thing

Kiss me baby
You sexy thing
You sexy thing

Touch me baby
You sexy thing
You sexy thing
I've been meaning to tell you
I've got this feelin that won't subside
I look at you and I fantasize
Your mine tonight
Now I've got you in my sights

With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I

I want to hold you so hear me out
I want to show you what love's all about
Darlin tonight
Now I've got you in my sights

Now I've got you in my sights
With these hungry eyes
Now did I take you by surprise
I need you to see
This love was meant to be
Find a way to my heart, and I
Will always be with you
From wherever you are, I'll be waiting
I'll keep a place in my heart, you
Will see it shining through
So find a way to my heart, and I
Will, I will follow you

This journey's not easyfor you, I know
If your footsteps get too faint to hear, I'll go
Cause you know, quesations are never that easy
And never the same
You have the answer believe me
If you have the faith

Find a way to my heart

Time may come, and time may go, I know
If you should call out for me, I'll go
But you know, there is a code to be broken
I wrap it around
Without a word being spoken
Without a sound

Ther's a reason I hide my heart
Out of sight out of mind
And when I find out just who you are
The door will be open for you to..

Find a way to my heart
Who knows what tomorrow brings 
In a world, few hearts survive 
All I know, is the way I feel 
When it's real, I keep my pray alive
The road is long 
There are mountains in our way 
But we climb steps every day
Love lift us up where we belong 
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high 
Love lift us up where we belong 
Far from the world we know 
Up where the clear winds blow
Some hang on to "used-to-be" 
Live their lives locking behind 
All we have is here and now 
All our lives, out there to find
The road is long 
There are mountains in our way 
But we climb steps every day
Love lift us up where we belong 
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high 
Love lift us up where we belong 
Far from the world we know 
Up where the clear winds blow
Time goes by 
No time to cry 
Life's you and I, alive, baby
Love lift us up where we belong 
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high 
Love lift us up where we belong 
Far from the world we know 
Up where the clear winds blow
Love lift us up where we belong 
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high 
Love lift us up where we belong 
Far from the world we know 
Up where the clear winds blow
I call you on the telephone my voice too rough with cigarettes.
I sometimes thing I should just go home but I'm dealing with a memory
that never forgets
I love to hear you say my name especially when you say yes
I got your body right now on my mind and I drunk myself b-lind to the
sound of old T-Rex
To the sound of old T-Rex, who's next?

When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet
You better bet your life
Or love will cut you like a knife

I want those feeble minded axes overthrown
I'm not into your passport picture I just like your nose
You welcome me with open arms and open legs
I know only fools have needs but this one never begs

I don't really mind how much you love me
A little is really alright
When you say come over and spend the night
Tonight

I lay on the bed with you
We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters
Saying "you better"
You better bet your life

You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now.

I showed up late one night with a neon light for a visa
But knowing I'm so eager to fight can't make letting me in any easier
I know tha~t I been wearing crazy clothes and I look pretty crappy
Sometime
But my body feels so good and I still sing a razor line everytime.

And when it comes to all night living
I know what I'm giving
I've got it all down to a tee
And it's free.

You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now.
Highway run
Into the midnight sun
Wheels go round and round
Youre on my mind
Restless hearts
Sleep alone tonight
Sendin all my love
Along the wire

They say that the road
Aint no place to start a family
Right down the line
Its been you and me
And lovin a music man
Aint always what its supposed to be
Oh girl you stand by me
Im forever yours, faithfully

Circus life
Under the big top world
We all need the clowns
To make us smile
Through space and time
Always another show
Wondering where I am
Lost without you

And being apart aint easy
On this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy
Of rediscovering you
Oh girl, you stand by me
Im forever yours, faithfully

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Faithfully, Im still yours
Im forever yours
Ever yours, faithfully
I just want to tell you all the things you are
And all the things you mean to me
When I find myself believing there's no place to go
When I feel the loneliness inside my heart
You're the answer to my prayers
And you're with me everywhere

You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need to know, tonight

Life is just a moment
We're blowing in the wind
We're trying to find a friend
And only time can tell us
If we win or if we lose
And who will stand beside us
When there's darkness all around me
You're the light I see
When I need someone to ease my troubled mind
You're the answer to my prayers
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need to know, oh, tonight

Oh, You'e my angel
You're the answer to my prayers
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, my miracle, you're all I need to know, tonight
You're all I need to know
Oh, you'e my angel
My angel, my my my my my angel.
You with the sad eyes 
Don't be discouraged 
Oh I realize 
It's hard to take courage 
In a world full of people 
You can lose sight of it all 
And the darkness, inside you 
Can make you feel so small 

But I see your true colors 
Shining through 
I see your true colors 
And that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show 
Your true colors 
True colors are beautiful, 
Like a rainbow 

Show me a smile then, 
Don't be unhappy, can't remember 
When I last saw you laughing 
If this world makes you crazy 
And you've taken all you can bear 
You call me up 
Because you know I'll be there 

And I'll see your true colors 
Shining through 
I see your true colors 
And that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show 
Your true colors 
True colors are beautiful, 
Like a rainbow 

So sad eyes 
Discouraged now 
Realize 

When this world makes you crazy 
And you've taken all you can bear 
You call me up 
Because you know I'll be there 

And I'll see your true colors 
Shining through 
I see your true colors 
And that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show 
Your true colors 
True colors, true colors 

Cos there's a shining through 
I see your true colors 
And that's why I love you 
So don't be afraid to let them show 
Your true colors, true colors 
True colors are beautiful, 
Beautiful, like a rainbow 
With a little love, and some tenderness
Well walk upon the water

With a little peace, and some harmony
Well take the world together
Well take em by the hand

Finally I figured out, 
But it took a long long time 
Now there's a turnabout, 
Maybe cause I'm tryin' 
There's been times, I'm so confused 
Down my road, will it lead to you? 
Just can't turn and walk away 

It's hard to say what it is I see in you 
Wonder if I'll always be with you 
Words can't say it, I can't do 
Enough to prove, it's all for you 

And I'd thought I seen it all, 
Cause it's been a long long time 
Oh bothered that we'll trip and fall, 
Wonderin' if I'm alive 
There's been times, I'm so confused 
Down my road, will it lead to you? 
I just can't turn, you walk away 

Its hard to say what it is I see in you 
Wonder if I'll always be with you 
Words can't say, and I can't do 
Enough to prove it's all for you 

Rain comes pourin' down, 
Fallin' from blue skies 
Words give out a sound, 
comin' from your eyes 

Finally I figured out, 
But it took a long long time 
Oh now there's a turnabout, 
Maybe cause I'm tryin' 
There's been times, I'm so confused 
Down my road, will it lead to you? 
Just can't turn, you walk away 

Its hard to say what it is I see in you

Words can't say, I can't do 
Enough to prove it's all for you 

Well it's hard to say what it is I see in you 
Wonder if I'll always be with you 
Words can't say, I can't do 
Enough to prove, it's all for you 

Hard to say 
Hard to say, it's all for you 
There's a wren in a willow wood
Flys so high and sings so good
And he brings to you, what he sings to you
Like my brother the wren and I
Well, he told if I try, I could fly for you
And I wanna try for you, 'cause

I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you, the peaceful feelin' of my home

Summer thunder on moon-bright days
Northern Lights and skies ablaze
And I bring to you, lover, when I sing to you
Silver wings in a fiery sky
Show the trail of my love and I
Sing to you, love is what I bring to you
And I wanna sing to you, oh

I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you, the peaceful feelin' of my home

I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you, the peaceful feelin' of my home
I wanna show you, the peaceful feelin' of my home
Face in the mirror looks the same every morning
I keep looking for a change
Sometimes I wonder am I standing still in time
Tired of doing everything the same old way
Tired of playing all the games that people play
This running round in circles gives me no peace of mind I need to find
I need the emotion
I need to laugh
Sometimes I need to cry
I need the emotion
I need to love so hard
I don't know what to do
And baby, I need you
Oh
Sometimes I need a good old fashioned fight
It doesn't matter If I'm wrong or right
Please don't worry about it
You know how much I care
Sometimes I need to make love all day long
Sometimes I need to hold you in my arms
Let's drift away together
It doesn't matter where
As long as you're there cause I need
I need the emotion
I need to laugh
Sometimes I need to cry
I need the emotion
I need to love so hard
I don't know what to do
And baby , I need you
Oooooooooooh
Sometimes I need to tear the whole thing down
Sometimes I need to turn it all around
When I put it back together I'll be calling out to you
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
I need the emotion
I need to laugh sometimes I need to cry
Cry...
I need the emotion
I need to feel each passing day go by
By
I need the emotion
I need to love so hard I don't know what to do
And baby I need you
I need the emotion
I need the emotion
Yes I do
I need the emotion
I need ya baby
I need, I need, I need emotion
Oh won't ya baby?

I need, I need, I need emotion
Every day

Emotion
Every hour

Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue.

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around.
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.

Wah, close to you.
Wah, close to you.
Ha, close to you.
Lah, close to you.
I get lost, in your eyes 
And I feel my spirits rise 
And soar like the wind 
Is it love that I am in? 
I get weak in a glance 
Isn't this what's called romance? 
And that's what I know 
Cause when I'm lost 
I can't let go

I don't mind 
Not knowing what I'm headed for 
You can take me to the skies 
It's like being lost in heaven 
When (and) I'm lost in your eyes
I just felt 
Don't know why 
Something is there 
We can't deny 
Ooh, when I first knew 
Was when I first looked at you 
And if I 
Can't find my way 
If salvation 
Seems miles away 
Oh, I'll be found 
When I'm lost in your eyes

I get weak in a glance 
Isn't this what's called romance 
Oh, I'll be found 
When I am lost 
In your eyes.
You can reach me by rail way
You can reach me by trail way
You can reach me on an airplane
You can reach me with your mind

You can reach me by caravan
Across the desert like a Arab man
I dont care how you get here
Just get here if you can

You can reach me by sail boat
Find a tree swing rope to rope
Take a sled and sly down slope
Into these arms of mine

You can jump on a speed boat
Across the border in a blazer role
I dont care how you get here
Just get here if you can

There are hills and mountains between us 
Always something to get over
If I had my way surely youd be closer
I need you closer

There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way surely youd be closer
I need you closer

You can win something to my like
Take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon
But you better get here soon

You can reach me by caravan
Across the desert like a Arab man
I dont care how you get here
Just get here if you can

I need you right here right now
I need you here by my side
I dont care how you get here
Just get here if you can
Touch me in the morning
Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday

(Hey!)
Wasn't it me who said that
Nothin’ good's gonna last forever?
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together?
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand your feeling that way
Everybody's got their life to live

Well, I can say goodbye in the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night
If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
‘Til you go I need to lie here and think about
The last time that you'll touch me in the morning,
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me,
Empty like before

(Hey!)
Wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us?
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us 
(Didn't we run!)
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been?
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again
Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies

If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
‘Til you go I need to hold you until the time
Your hands reach out and...

Touch me in the morning
(Mornings were blue and gold, and we could feel one another living)
Then just walk away
(We walked with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was
giving)
We don't have tomorrow,
(There's no tomorrow here, there's only love and the time to chase it)
But we had yesterday
(But yesterday's gone my love, there's only now and it's time to face
it)

Touch me in the morning
(Wasn’t it me who said that nothin’ good’s gonna last forever?)
Then just walk away
(And wasn't it me who said let's just be glad for the time together?)	
We don’t have tomorrow
(Wasn't it yesterday we used to laugh at the wind behind us?)	
But we had yesterday
(Yesterday’s gone my love...)
If you need me, call me. 
No matter where you are, 
no matter how far. 
Just call my name. 
I'll be there in a hurry. On that you can depend 
and never worry. 
You see, my love is alive 
it's like a seed that only needs 
the thought of you to grow. 
So if you feel the need for company, 
please, my darling, let it be me. 
I may not be asble to express 
the depth of the love I feel for you, 
but a writer put it very nicely. 
When he was away from the one he loved, 
he sat down and wrote these words: 
No wind, no rain 
nor winter's cold 
can stop me, babe 
if you're my goal 
No wind, no rain 
can stop me, babe 
if you wanna go 
I know, I know you must follow the sun 
wherever it leads 
but remember 
if you should fall short of your desires 
remember life holds for you one guarantee 
you'll always have me 
And if you should miss my love 
one of these old days 
if you should ever miss the arms 
that used to hold you so close, or the lips 
that used to touch you so tenderly 
just remember what I told you 
the day I set you free 

Ain't no mountain high enough 
Ain't no valley low enough 
Ain't no river wild enough 

To keep me from you.
If you need me, call me. 
No matter where you are, 
no matter how far. 
Just call my name.

No-one on earth could feel like this. 
I'm thrown and overblown with bliss. 
There must be an angel 
Playing with my heart. 
I walk into an empty room 
And suddenly my heart goes boom! 
It's an orchestra of angels 
And they're playing with my heart. 
(Must be talking to an angel) 
No-one on earth could feel like this. 
I'm thrown and overblown with bliss. 
There must be an angel 
Playing with my heart. 
And when I think that I'm alone 
It seems there's more of us at home. 
It's a multitude of angels 
And they're playing with my heart. 
Chorus repeats. 
I must be hallucinating 
Watching angels celebrating. 
Could this be reactivating 
All my senses dislocating? 
This must be a strange deception 
By celestial intervention. 
Leavin' me the recollection 
Of your heavenly connection 
Maybe I hang around here
A little more than I should
We both know I got somewhere else to go
But I got something to tell you
That I never thought I would
But I believe you really ought to know

I love you
I honestly love you

You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid
This is pure and simple
And you should realize
That it's coming from my heart and not my head

I love you
I honestly love you

I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all
But this feeling doesn't come along everyday
And you shouldn't blow the chance
When you've got the chance to say

I love you
I honestly love you

If we both were born
In anoother place and time
This moment might be ending in a kiss
But there you are with yours
And here I am with mine
So I guess we'll just be leaving it at this

I love you
I honestly love you
I honestly love you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you 
It seems the natural thing to do 
Tonight no one's gonna find us 
We'll leave the world behind us 
When I make love to you 

Tonight I celebrate my love for you 
And hope that deep inside you feel it too 
Tonight our spirits will be climbing 
To the sky lit up with diamonds 
When I make love to you tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you (ooh) 
And that midnight song is gonna come shining through 
Tonight there'll be no distance between us 
What I want most to do 
Is to get close to you tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you 
And soon this old world will seem brand new 
Tonight we will both discover 
How friends turn into lovers 
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you (ooh) 
And that midnight song is gonna come shining through 
Tonight there'll be no distance between us 
What I want most to do 
Is to get close to you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her

And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl

Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
Possible she wants you to
There is one way to ask her

It don't take a word
Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl

Sha la la la la la, my oh my
Look like the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl

Sha la la la la la, ain't that sad
Ain't it a shame, too bad
He gonna miss the girl

Now's your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy, you'd better do it soon
No time will be better

She don't say a word
And she won't say a word
Until you kiss the girl

Sha la la la la la, don't be scared
You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl

Sha la la la la la, don't stop now
Don't try to hide it
How you wanna kiss the girl

Sha la la la la la, float along
And listen to the song
The song say kiss the girl

Sha la la la la la, the music play
Do what the music say
You gotta kiss the girl

You've gotta kiss the girl
You wanna kiss the girl
You've gotta kiss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl
I wake up every mornin', I stumble out of bed
Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead
It seems to last forever, and time goes slowly by
Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly

'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off

My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him

My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him

He takes me to a movie, or to a restaurant, to go
Slow dancing, anything I want
Only when he's with me, I catch light
Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him

All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him, and he's crazy mad for me
When he steps off that train, I'm makin' a fool, a fight
Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night

My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him

My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him

He's always on that morning train
He works so hard
To find me waiting for him

Baby, when I think about you
I think about love.
Darlin, couldn't live without you 
And your love.

If I had those golden dreams of my yesterday
I would wrap you 
In the heavens
And feel it dyin (dyin, dyin) all the way

I feel like makin
Feel like makin love 
Feel like makin love
Feel like makin love
Feel like makin love to you

Baby, if I think about you 
I think about love.
Darlin, if I live without you
I live without love.

If I had the sun and moon
and they were shinin 
I would give you both night and day
Love satisfyin

I feel like makin
Feel like makin love
Feel like makin love
Feel like makin love 
Feel like makin love to you

And if I had those golden dreams of my yesterday
I would wrap you 
In the heavens
And feel it dyin (dyin, dyin) all the way

We were strangers, starting out on a journey
Never dreaming, what we'd have to go through
Now here we are, I'm suddenly standing
At the beginning with you

No one told me I was going to find you
Unexpected, what you did to my heart
When I lost hope, you were there to remind me
This is the start

And life is a road that I wanna keep going
Love is a river, I wanna keep flowing
Life is a road, now and forever, wonderful journey
I'll be there when the world stops turning
I'll be there when the storm is through
In the end I wanna be standing
At the beginning with you

We were strangers on a crazy adventure
Never dreaming, how our dreams would come true
Now here we stand, unafraid of the future
At the beginning with you

And life is a road that I wanna keep going
Love is a river, I wanna keep flowing
Life is a road, now and forever, wonderful journey
I'll be there when the world stops turning
I'll be there when the storm is through
In the end I wanna be standing
At the beginning with you

Knew there was somebody, somewhere
A new love in the dark
Now I know my dream will live on
I've been waiting so long
Nothing's gonna tear us apart

And life is a road that I wanna keep going
Love is a river, I wanna keep flowing
Life is a road, now and forever, wonderful journey
I'll be there when the world stops turning
I'll be there when the storm is through
In the end I wanna be standing
At the beginning with you

Yeah

Life is a road that I wanna keep going on
Love is a river, I wanna keep going

Starting out on a journey

Life is a road that I wanna keep going
Love is a river, I wanna keep flowing
In the end I wanna be standing
At the beginning with you 
I thought that dreams belonged to other men
Cause each time I got close
They’d fall apart again

I feared my heart would beat in secrecy
I faced the nights alone
Oh, how could I have known
That all my life I only needed you? 

Whoa
Almost paradise
We’re knockin’ on heaven’s door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more? 
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise

It seems like perfect love’s so hard to find
I’d almost given up
You must have read my mind

And all these dreams I saved for a rainy day
They’re finally coming true
I’ll share them all with you
’Cause now we hold the future in our hands

Whoa
Almost paradise
We’re knockin’ on heaven’s door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more? 
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise

And in your arms salvation’s not so far away
It’s getting closer
Closer every day

It’s almost paradise
We’re knockin’ on heaven’s door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more? 
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise

Whoa
Almost paradise
We’re knockin’ on heaven’s door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more? 
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
When I get home, babe, gonna light your fire
All day I've been thinkin' about you, babe
You're my one desire

Gonna wrap my arms around you
Hold you close to me
Oh, babe I wanna taste your lips
I wanna be your fantasy, yeah

Don't know what I'd do without you, babe
Don't know where I'd be
You're not just another lover
No, you're everything to me

Everytime I'm with you, baby
I can't believe it's true
When you're layin' in my arms
And you do the things you do

You can see it in my eyes
I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing
Just let me show how much
I love you, I need you, yeah

I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in

Stay with me, lay with me, holding me, loving me, baby
Here with me, near with me, feeling you close to me, baby

So show me, show me ev'rything you do
Cause baby no one does it quite like you

I love you, I need you, oh, babe

I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
There's something that I want to say
But words sometimes get in the way
I just want to show
My feelings for you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
Than spend ev'ry moment with you
I guess you should know
I love you so

You are my lady
You're everything I need and more
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

There's no way that I can resist
Your precious kiss
Girl, you've got me
So hypnotized
Just say that you'll stay with me (you'll stay)
'Cause our love was meant to be
I promise to love you
More each day

You are my lady (my love)
You're everything I need and more (oh, oh, oh)
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

You are my lady (my love)
You're everything I need and more (oh, oh, oh)
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

You are my lady (my love)
You're everything I need and more (oh, oh, oh)
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

I love your shine
(Shine, shine, shine)
Let's make it last
Until the end of time

You are my lady (my love)
You're everything I need and more (oh, oh, oh)
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

You are my lady (my love)
You're everything I need and more (oh, oh, oh)
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

Love, love is a dream
We were like two young strands of driftwood
Caught up in the stream
We were destined for each other
From our very first hello
We came bustin' through that river dam
And made that river flow
We will sale upon the ocean
'Til the shoreline meets the sky
Carried on the first trade wind
That favours you and I
We have both of us between us
Known misfortune in our days
But, darling this time we're on our way
'Cause we're here
And here we'll stay
We won't ever throw this love of ours away
We are here
And here we'll stay
We won't ever throw this love of ours away
Life, oh life is a chance
We were the only two who spun the wheel
And never scored romance
And if we'd stayed to play for fortune
We'd have broke the banks of gold
We'd have taken old Las Vegas
For every cent that she could hold
Love like ours was made in heaven
It was blessed by Lord above
We will spend our lives together
Forever hand in glove
We have both of us between us
Known misfortune in our days
But, darling this time we're on our way
'Cause we're here
You know I need your love
You've got that hold over me
Long as I've got your love
You know that I'll never leave
When I wanted you to share my life
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you woman
Right down the line

I know how much I lean on you
Only you can see
The changes that I've been through
Have left a mark on me
You've been as constant as a Northern Star
The brightest light that shines
It's been you woman right down the line

I just wanna say this is my way
Of tellin' you everything
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of tellin' you
That every day I'm lovin' you so much more
'Cause you believed in me through my darkest night
Put somethin' better inside of me
You brought me into the light
Threw away all those crazy dreams
I put them all behind
And it was you woman
Right down the line

I just wanna say this is my way of tellin' you everything
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of tellin' you
Everything I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of tellin' you
That every day I'm lovin' you so much more

If I should doubt myself, if I'm losing ground
I won't turn to someone else
They'd only let me down
When I wanted you to share my life
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you woman
Right down the line

Today started with a crazy kiss
On our way home
We were in for a surprise
Who would have known

Who would have thought that we would become lovers
As friends we were so, so tight
Can’t help myself, you make me feel so right
I got to, got to, got to tell you, darlin’

Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe

I think I love you from head to toe
I know

Here today, gone tomorrow
It’s possible, but I doubt it
His kiss is credit in the bank of love
I never leave home without it

He’s different from any boy I know
Body supreme
Bedroom eyes, head back to the side
Please don’t be so mean

14 karat love, you are my jewel of the Nile
When we make love diamonds are forever
Top to bottom I love you, I will leave you never
I got to, got to, got to tell you, darlin’

Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby, I’ve got to kiss you
From head to toe

Ooh, baby, I think I love you
You got to know
Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe

I think I love you from head to toe
You can’t hurry love, you got to take it slow
But my angel, you forget your wings tonight (Heaven up above)
Baby, you got the love

14 karat love, you are my jewel of the Nile
When we make love diamonds are forever
Top to bottom I love you, I will leave you never

Holdin' you close through the night

What happiness really means

Would go down under

I'll be loving you forever
Just as long as you want me to be

We've learned to fall to every turn by now
This love will last forever

Loving only you, girl
Oh girl
I'll be loving only you
(I'll be loving you)
(I'll be loving you)
Be loving you girl
Feel your breath on my shoulder 
And I know we couldn't get any closer 
I don't wanna act tough 
I just wanna fall in love 
As we move into the night 
I get crazy 
Thinking how it's gonna be with you, baby 
I don't wanna play rough 
I've been loving you enough, oh baby

Wanna take forever tonight 
Wanna stay in this moment forever 
I'm gonna give you 
All the love that I've got 
I wanna take forever tonight 
Fill you up, fill you up with love 
When we close the door 
All I need is in your eyes 

I wanna take forever tonight
Touch my lips, I'm on fire 
You're the only one 
I'll ever desire 
Turn the lights down low 
Make the world go slow 
When I'm holding you tonight 
It's so easy 
Nothing moves me like you do 
When you tease me 
And to rush would be a crime 
I just wanna spend some time with you, baby
Wanna take forever tonight 
Wanna stay in this moment forever 
I'm gonna give you 
All the love that I've got 

I wanna take forever tonight 
Fill you up, fill you up 
Give you all my love tonight 
When we close the door 
All I need is in your eyes 

I wanna take forever
And when I'm here beside you 
I wanna see what drives you 
Out of your mind 
Oh baby 

I never wanna leave 
I only wanna be with you 
'Cause I love how I feel 
Your love is for real

I wanna take forever tonight 
Wanna stay in this moment forever 
I'm gonna give you 
All the love that I've got
I wanna take forever tonight 
Wanna stay in this moment forever 
I'm gonna give you 
All the love that I've got 
'Cause I can't live without you
I dont wanna lose you
I dont want you walking away
Were so good together
Tell me its forever, cause I want you to stay

Ill be damned if Im living without you
And as long as I live, you will know
I just wanna build my world around you
Dont want you to go

Dont leave me here with my restless heart
(the) one you filled with emotion baby
Right from the start
cause the hardest part
Is being alone
With my restless heart

Tell me where you want me
Anytime I dont care
Tell me when you need me
cause baby when you need me, I will be right there

Ill be damned if Im living without you
And as long as I live, you will know
I will never build a wall around you
(He) dont want you to go

Dont leave me here with my restless heart
The one you filled with emotion baby
Right from the start
And the hardest part
Is being alone
With my restless heart

Ill be damned if Im living without you
And as long as I live, you will know
I just wanna build my world around you
I dont want you to go

Dont leave me here with my restless heart
The one you filled with emotion right from the start
cause the hardest part is being alone
With my restless heart
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

Now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
You are the sunshine of my life
Thats why Ill always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever youll stay in my heart

I feel like this is the beginning
Though Ive loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
Id find myself drowning in my own tears

You are the sunshine of my life
Thats why Ill always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever youll stay in my heart

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you? 

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
Thats why Ill always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever youll stay in my heart

Love has joined us
Love has joined us
Lets think sweet love
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side 

I see the questions in your eyes 
I know what's weighing on your mind 
You can be sure I know my heart 

`Coz I'll stand beside you through the years 
You'll only cry those happy tears 
And though I make mistakes 
I'll never break your heart 

And I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there 
I swear like a shadow that's by your side 
I'll be there 

For better or worse, till death do us part 
I'll love you with every beat of my heart 
And I swear 

I'll give you every thing I can 
I'll build your dreams with these two hands 
We'll hang some memories on the walls 

And when just the two of us are there 
You won't have to ask if I still care 
`Coz as the time turns the page, my love won't age at all 

And I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I swear (and I swear) like the shadow that's by your side 
I'll be there 

For better or worse, till death do us part 
I'll love you with every beat of my heart 
And I swear 

I swear (I swear) by the moon and stars in the sky 
I'll be there 
I swear like the shadow that's by your side 
I'll be there 

For better or worse, till death do us part 
I'll love you with every (single) beat of my heart 
I swear, I swear, oh, I, swear
I lost at love before
Got mad and closed the door
But your sun shined just once more

I chose you for the one
Now we're having so much fun
You treated me so kind
I'm about to lose my mind
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life

The others were untrue
But when it came to loving you
I'd spend my whole life through

'Cause you came and you took control
You touch my very soul
You always showed me that
Loving you is where it's at
You made me so very happy	
I'm so glad you came into my life

Thank you baby

I love so much you see
You're even in my dreams
I can hear you, I can hear you callin' me
I'm so much in love with you
All I ever want to do is
Thank you baby, thank you baby

You make me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
You made me so very happy
You made me so very happy, baby
I'm so glad you came
Into my life

I want to thank you boy
Thank you baby
I believe the morning sun
Always gonna shine again and
I believe a pot of gold
Waits at every rainbow's end, oh
I believe in roses kissed with dew
Why shouldn't I believe the same in you?

I believe in make believe
Fairy tales and lucky charms and
I believe in promises
Spoken as you cross your heart, oh
I believe in skies forever blue
Why shouldn't I believe the same in you?

You may say I'm a fool
Feelin' the way that I do
You can call me Pollyanna
Say I'm crazy as a loon
I believe in silver linings
And that's why I believe in you

I believe there'll come a day
Mabe it will be tomorrow
When the blue bird flies away
All we have to do is follow
I believe a dream can still come true
Why shouldn't I believe the same in you

You may say I'm a fool
Feelin' the way that I do
I believe in friends and laughter
And the wonders love can do
I believe in songs and magic
And that's why I believe in you

You may say I'm a fool
Feelin' this way about you
There's not much I can do
I'm gonna be this way my life through
'Cause I still believe in miracles
I swear I've seen a few
And the time will surely come
When you can see my point of veiw
I believe in second chances
And that's why I believe in you
I run a comb through my hair
and step out in the street
And the city's the color of flame
in the mid-summer heat
Oh yeah

Jennifer's got her daddy's car,
She's playing Uptown on the stereo
We go cruisin' so close,
The way they did long ago
My darling

(Turn) turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close never let me go
(Keep) keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
Baby, baby

(When) when I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) take me over the edge
Make me lose control

We put the top down and park 'neath the moon
in the sky
And the wind is so hot in our hair, like a fire in July
Whoa yeah

Jennifer's singin' Stand By Me,
And she knows every single word by heart
Was love always this good?
Or could this be just the start?
Whoa darling

(Turn) turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close never let me go
(Keep) keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
Baby, baby

(When) when I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) take me over the edge
Make me lose control

Be My Baby comes on, and were movin' in time
And the heat from your touch makes me feel
like I'm losing my mind
Whoa yeah

(And then they played) Back In My Arms again
(We close our eyes) we start rememberin' when
(We start to kiss) and now the feeling's intense
And we just pray that this night never ends
Wohohoho, my darling

(Turn) turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
Baby

When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) take me over the edge
Make me lose control
Baby, baby

(Turn) turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close never let me go
(Keep) keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control

When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
(So take) take me over the edge
Make me lose control
Baby, baby

(Turn) turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close never let me go
(Keep) keep this feelin' alive
Make me lose control
There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys you can trust
And girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

I swear i won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bibte
Just look in my eyes
I've waited so long baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where mine ends

I want your sex
I want you
I want your sex

It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go
I'd really like to try
Oh i'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then i tell you that i love you but you still say no!

I swear i won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bibte
Just look in my eyes
I've waited so long baby
Out in the cold

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your, sex

It's natural
It's chemical (let's do it)
It's logical
Habitual (can we do it?)
It's sensual
But most of all...
Sex is something we should do
Sex is something for me and you

Sex is natural - sex is good
Not everybody does it
But everybody should
Sex is natural - sex is fun
Sex is best when it's, one on one
One on one

I'm not your father
I'm not your brother
Talk to your sister
I am a lover

Sophistofunk, aristocats
Distinguished dawgs, clean up your act
Pull up your pants, ladies and gents
Please, act like you got some sense
You know what I really wanna know?
Where do all the good girls go
What clubs they hang at?

Behold a lady
I see you standing on the wall
Clap, clap... you deserve it all [Repeat]
[While it repeats]
Candy-coated unicorns are quite hard to find
The classic lady, a rare breed indeed
Is that make and model discontinued?

Today I might snow, tomorrow I'll rain
3000's always changing but you stay the same
And I need that, hey I need that (in my life)
When I feel washed up and inadequate
And throw all my songs away, no matter how mad I get
You make me smile, you make me smile
You make me smile, you make me... (Hooooo!)
You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking
You won't let me drown and I'm grateful

Behold a lady
I see you standing on the wall
Clap, clap... you deserve it all [Repeat]
[While it repeats]
Candy-coated unicorns are quite hard to find
The classic lady, a rare breed indeed
Is that make and model discontinued?

Maybe they disappeared with the dinosaurs,
Oh but that's just the big bang theory,
Maybe they're still around,
But only to be seen with appreciative eyes,
Maybe they were taken for granted,
And lost all their magic,
Oh how awful,
Oh so tragic.

Yo' mama's old fashioned, yo' daddy don't play
You'll always be this lovely
'Cause they raised you that way
Hallelujah! Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
You're not extra extra, you're so plain Jane
The yin to my yang, darlin'
You've got that thang and you know it
But yet you don't (But yet you don't) and that's what's so cool
You don't say too much, but when you do it's profound
In the street you hold your head high
At home you get low down for me
Can't get no lower, can't get no lower, can't get no lower, yeah!
Hoooo! You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown (Aaaaaaahh!)
Sad, but one day our kids will have to visit museums
To see what a lady looks like

Behold a lady
I see you standing on the wall
Clap, clap, you deserve it all

Candy-coated unicorns are quite hard to find
The classic lady, a rare breed indeed
Is that make and model discontinued?

So if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight
Yes, if you spot one, good sir, treat her right

Something to last for all time

The closer I get to you
The more you'll make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

Lying here next to you 
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Let's give love a try

Sweeter than sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With the hearts in love they find
True love
In a special way

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving you all I've got
Your love has captured me

The closer I get to you
A feeling comes over me
(Me too)
Pulling closer
Girl, its been a long time that weve been apart
Much too long for a man who needs love
I miss you since Ive been away
Babe, it wasnt easy to leave you alone
Its getting harder each time that I go
If I had the choice, I would stay

Theres no one like you
I cant wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we do
I just wanna be loved by you

No one like you
I cant wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we do
I just wanna be loved by you

Girl, there are really no words strong enough
To describe all my longing for love
I dont want my feelings restrained
Ooh, babe, I just need you like never before
Just imagine youd come through this door
Youd take all my sorrow away

Theres no one like you
I cant wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we do
I just wanna be loved by you

No one like you
I cant wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we do

I don't care what they think of me
And I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think if you're leavin'
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But bein' with you
Bein' with you

Honey, don't go
Don't leave this scene
Be out of the picture
And off of the screen
Don't let them say
We told you so
They tell me you love me
And then let me go
I heard the warnin' voice
From friends and my relations
They tell me all about your
Heart-break reputation

But I don't care what they think about me
And I don't care what they say, no
I don't care what they think if you're leavin'
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But bein' with you
Bein' with you

People can change they always do
Haven't they noticed the changes in you
Or can it be that like love I am blind
Do I want it so much
'Til it's all in my mind
One thing I know for sure
It's really, really, real
I never felt before
The way you make me feel

I don't care what they think about me
And I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think if you're leavin'
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But bein' with you
Bein' with you
Bein' with you

Bein' with you
I don't care about anything else
But bein' with you
Bein' with you
Bein' with you
They say we're young and we don't know 
We won't find out until we grow 
Well I don't know if all that's true
'Cause you got me, and baby I got you 

Babe 
I got you babe I got you babe 

They say our love won't pay the rent 
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent 
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot 
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got 

Babe 
I got you babe I got you babe 

Got flowers in the spring I got you to wear my ring 
And when I'm sad, you're a clown 
And if I get scared, you're always around 
So let them say your hair's too long 
Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong 
Then put your little hand in mine 
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb 

Babe 
I got you babe I got you babe 

I got you to hold my hand 
I got you to understand 
I got you to walk with me 
I got you to talk with me 
I got you to kiss goodnight 
I got you to hold me tight 
I got you, I won't let go 
I got you to love me so 

I got you babe 
I got you babe 
I got you babe 
I got you babe 
I got you babe 
My love, I'll never find the words, my love
To tell you how I feel, my love
Mere words could not explain
Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again
Only you
Came when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you
Filled with gratitude and love
God bless you

You make me feel brand new
I sing this song for you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song cause' you
Make me feel brand new

My love
When others made me insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me
Precious friend
In you I always have a friend
You're one on whom I can depend
To walk a path that sometimes bends
Without you
Life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay
You for having faith in me
God bless you

You make me feel brand new
I sing this song for you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song for you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you 
I heat up, I can't cool down
You got me spinnin'
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Where it stops nobody knows

Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame full of desire
Kiss me baby, let the fire get higher

Abra-abra-cadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra

You make me hot, you make me sigh
You make me laugh, you make me cry
Keep me burnin' for your love
With the touch of a velvet glove

Abra-abra-cadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra

I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin, leather and lace
Black panties with an angel's face

I see magic in your eyes
I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think I'm gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say

Abra-abra-cadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra

Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame full of desire
Kiss me baby, let the fire get higher

I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
Lying beside you, here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mind
Softly you whisper, youre so sincere
How could our live be so blind
We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you, with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping youll see what your love means to me
Open arms

Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that youve come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay
You
I don't know what to say
You take my breath away
You're every song I sing
You're the music that I play
And you take my breath away

You
You smile and it's okay
You take my breath away
Like water from a stream
On a sizzling summer day
You take my breath away
There are words for the magic of a sunrise
Only none of them will do for you
As we stroll along together
Holding hands, walking all alone
So in love are we two
That we don't know what to do
So in love (doo, so in love)
In a world of our own (doo, so in love)

As we stroll by the sea together
Under stars twinkling high above
So in love are we two
No one else but me and you
So in love (doo, so in love)
So much in love (doo, so in love)
So in love (doo, so in love)
So much in love (doo, so in love)

We stroll along together
I tell you I need you oh so much
I love, love you my darling
Can you tell it in my touch?

When we walk down the aisle together
We will vow to be together till we die
So much love have we two
Just can't wait to say I do
So in love (doo, so in love)
Are you and I (doo, you and I)
So in love (doo, so in love)
Are you and I (doo, you and I)
So in love (doo, so in love)
Are you and I (doo, you and I)
For so long

And the feeling that I feel for you is more then strong , girl

Not like you think 
I didn't mean to turn you on 

I know you 
Were expecting a one night stand 
When I refused 
I knew you wouldn't understand 

I told you twice 
I was only trying to be nice 
Only trying to be nice 
Ooh, I didn't mean to turn you on 

Babe now why should I 
Feel guilty 'cause I won't give 
Guilty 'cause I won't give in 
I didn't mean to turn you on 
Ooh, I didn't mean to turn you on 

When I took you out 
Iknew what you were all about 
But when I did 
I didn't mean to turn you on 
No, I didn't mean to turn you on 

I didn't mean to turn you on
When people keep repeating 
That you'll never fall in love 
When everybody keeps retreating 
But you can't seem to get enough 

Let my love open the door 
Let my love open the door 
Let my love open the door 
To your heart 

When everything feels all over 
When everybody seems unkind 
I'll give you a four leaf clover 
Take all the worry out of your mind 

Let my love open the door 
Let my love open the door 
Let my love open the door 
To your heart 

I have the only key to your heart 
I can stop you falling apart 
Try today, you'll find this way 
Come on and give me a chance to say 
Let my love open the door 
It's all I'm living for 
Release yourself from misery 
There's only one thing gonna set you free 
That's my love 

Let my love open the door 
Let my love open the door 
Let my love open the door 
To your heart 

When tragedy befalls you 
Don't let it drag you down 
Love can cure your problems 
You're so lucky I'm around 

Let my love open the door 
Let my love open the door 
Let my love open the door 
To your heart

If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

Well you got your reasons
And you got your lies
And you got your manipulations
They cut me down to size

Sayin you love but you dont
You give your love but you wont

If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

Seems the road less traveled
Shows happiness unraveled
And you got to take a little dirt
To keep what you love
Thats what you gotta do

Sayin you love but you dont
You give your love but you wont
Youre stretching out your arms to something thats just not there
Sayin you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can

If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

Sayin you love but you dont
You give your love but you wont
Sayin you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can

If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

Fortunately you have 
Someone who relies on you 
We started out as friends 
But the thought of you just caves me in 
The symptoms are so deep 
It is much too late to turn away 
We started out as friends

Sign your name 
Across my heart 
I want you to be my baby 
Sign your name 
Across my heart 
I want you to be my lady

Time I'm sure will bring 
Disappointments in so many things 
It seems to be the way 
When you're gambling cards on love you play 
I'd rather be in Hell with you baby 
Than in cool Heaven 
It seems to be the way

Sign your name 
Across my heart 
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name 
Across my heart 
I want you to be my lady

Birds never look into the sun 
Before the day is gone 
But oh the light shines brighter 
On a peaceful day 
Stranger blue leave us alone 
We don't want to deal with you 
We'll shed our stains showering 
In the room that makes the rain
All alone with you 
Makes the butterflies in me arise 
Slowly we make love 
And the Earth rotates 
To our dictates 
Slowly we make love

Sign your name 
Across my heart 
I want you to be my baby 
Sign your name 
Across my heart 
I want you to be my lady
We got the afternoon,
You got this room for two,
One thing I've left to do,
Discover me,
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of,
Your skin like porcelain,
One pair of candy lips and,
Your bubblegum tongue

Cause if you want love,
We'll make it,
Swim in a deep sea,
Of blankets,
Take all your big plans,
And break 'em,
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland,
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands),
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way the hair falls in your face,
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase,
You tell me where to go and,
Though I might leave to find it,
I'll never let your head hit the bed,
Without my hand behind it

You want love,
We'll make it,
Swim in a deep sea,
Of blankets,
Take all your big plans,
And break 'em,
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland,
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands),
Your body is a wonderland.

Damn baby,
You frustrate me,
I know you're mine, all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland,
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands),
Your body is a wonderland,
Your body is a wonderland
Oh, yeah 
Alright 
Here we go again 
Hey, hey, oh, oh 
Nah, nah, hey, hey 
Give a little bit
Give a little bit of your love to me
I'll give a little bit
I'll give a little bit of my love to you
There's so much that we need to share
So send a smile and show you care

I'll give a little bit
I'll give a little bit of my life for you
So give a little bit
Give a little bit of your time to me
See the man with the lonely eyes
Take his hand, you'll be surprised

Give a little bit
Give a little bit of your love to me
I'll give a little bit
I'll give a little bit of my life for you
Now's the time that we need to share
So find yourself, we're on our way back home

Going home
Don't you need, don't you need to feel at home?
Oh yeah, we gotta sing

Come along too
For the long run
Come a long way
Oh, sing it tonight
We've had some fun, and yes weve had our ups and downs
Been down that rocky road, but here we are, still around
We thought about someone else, but neither one took the bait
We thought about breaking up, but now we know its much too late
We are bound by all the rest
Like the same phone number
All the same friends
And the same address

Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I am happy to be stuck with you
Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) Im so happy to be stuck with you
cause I can see, (I can see) that youre happy to be stuck with me

Weve had our doubts, we never took them seriously
And weve had our ins and outs, but thats the way its supposed to be
We thought about giving up, but we could never stay away
Thought about breaking up, but now we know its much too late
And its no great mystery
If we change our minds
Eventually, its back to you and me

Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I am happy to be stuck with you
Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) Im so happy to be stuck with you
cause I can see, (I can see) that youre happy to be stuck with me

We are bound by all the rest
Like the same phone number
All the same friends
And the same address

Yes, i'ts true, (yes it's true) I am happy to be stuck with you
Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) Im so happy to be stuck with you
cause I can see, (I can see) that youre happy to be stuck with me
(yes it's true) Im so happy to be stuck with you
Im happy to be stuck with you
Happy to be stuck with you.
If I should stay, 
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know 
I'll think of you every step of the way.

And I will always love you
I will always love you
You, my darling you

Bittersweet memories 
that is all I'm taking with me
So, goodbye. Please, don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need

And I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life treats you kind 
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish to you, joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

And I will always love you.
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I, I will always love you

You, darling, I love you
Oh, I'll always, I'll always love you
When a man loves a woman

Turn his back on his best friend
If he put her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comfort
Sleep out in the rain

I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your precious love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool

He can never own some other girl
Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're my world

When a man loves a woman

Can't keep his mind on nothing else

When a man loves a woman

When Im feeling blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then Im not so blue
When youre close to me, I can feel your heart beat
I can hear you breathing near my ear
Wouldnt you agree, baby you and me got a groovy kind of love

Anytime you want to you can turn me onto
Anything you want to, anytime at all
When I kiss your lips, ooh I start to shiver
Cant control the quivering inside
Wouldnt you agree, baby you and me got a groovy kind of love, oh

When Im feeling blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then Im not so blue
When Im in your arms, nothing seems to matter
My whole world could shatter, I dont care
Wouldnt you agree, baby you and me got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love, oh
We got a groovy kind of love
Oh, my love, my darling,
I've hungered for your touch a long, lonely time,
Time goes by so slowly and time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love, God speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh, Wait for me, wait for me
'I'll be coming home, wait for me

Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love, God speed your love to me
All I am,
All I'll be
Everything in this world
All that I'll ever need
Is in your eyes
Shining at me
When you smile I can feel
All my passion unfolding
Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations
Seduce me 'cause I

I do cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will love you still
from the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
I do

In my world, before you
I lived outside my emotions
Didn't know where I was going
'Til the day I foundyou
How you opened my life
To a new paradise
In a world torn by change
still with all my of my heart
'Til my dying day

I do cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will love you still
from the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
I do

I do cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will love you still
from the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
I do

The loneliness of nights alone
The search for strength to carry on
My every hope has seemed to die
My eyes had no more tears to cry
Then like the sun shinned from up above
You surrounded me with your endless love
And all the things I couldn't see
Are now so clear to me

You are my everything
Nothing your love won't bring
My life is yours alone
The only love I've ever known
Your spirit pulls me through
When nothing else will do
Every night I pray
On bended knee
That you will always be
My everything

Now all my hopes and all my dreams
Are suddenly reality
You've opened up my heart to feel
A kind of love that's truly real
A guiding light that'll never fade
There's not a thing in life that I would ever trade
For the love you give it won't let go
I hope you'll always know

You are my everything
Nothing your love won't bring
My life is yours alone
The only love I've ever known
Your spirit pulls me through
When nothing else will do
Every night I pray
On bended knee
That you will always be
My everything

Oh
You're the breath of life in me
The only one that sets me free
And you have made my soul complete for all time
For all time

You are my everything
Nothing your love won't bring
My life is yours alone
The only love I've ever known
Your spirit pulls me through
When nothing else will do
Every night I pray
On bended knee
That you will always be
My everything

You are my everything
Nothing your love won't bring
My life is yours alone
The only love I've ever known
Your spirit pulls me through
When nothing else will do
Every night I pray
On bended knee
That you will always be
My everything, oh my everything
I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Well, every moment spent with you
Is a moment I treasure

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lying close to you
Feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you
In this moment forever, forever and ever

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
Well, I just wanna be with you
Right here with you, just like this
I just wanna hold you close
Feel your heart so close to mine
And stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time

Don't wanna close my eyes
Don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
Cause I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Don't wanna close my eyes
Don't wanna fall asleep, yeah
I don't wanna miss a thing
I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is all right with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Since, since we've been together
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Let's, let's stay together
Lovin' you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why, why some people break up
Then turn around and make up
I just can't see
You'd never do that to me (would you, baby)
Staying around you is all I see
(Here's what I want us to do)

Let's, we oughta stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
When your world is full of strange arrangements
And gravity won't pull you through
You know you're missing out on something
Well that something depends on you

All I'm saying, It takes a lot to love you
All I'm doing, you know it's true
All I need now, there's one thing
Yes one thing that turns this, grey sky to blue

That's the look, That's the look
The look of love

When your girl has left you out on the pavement
Then your dreams fall apart at the seams
Your reason for living's your reason for leaving
Don't ask me what it means

Who's got the look? I don't know the answer to that question
What's the look? If I knew I would tell you
What's the look? Look for your information
Yes there's one thing, the one thing that still hold true

That's the look, that's the look
The look of love

If you judge a book by the cover
Then you judge the book by the lover
I hope you'll soon recover
Me, I go from one extreme to another

And though my friends just might ask me
They say "Martin maybe one day you'll find true love"
I say "Maybe there must be a solution 
To the one thing we can't find"

That's the look, That's the look 
The look of love

That's the look That's the look
The look of love

Have I ever told you
How good it feels to hold you
It isn't easy to explain
And though I'm really trying
I think I may start crying
My heart can't wait another day
When you touch me I just got to say

Baby I love you,baby I love you
Baby I love you,come on baby now
I can't live without you
I love everything about you

I can't help it if I feel this way
Oh I'm so glad I found you

To me baby that you feel the same
Baby I love you,baby I love you
Baby I love you,come on baby now

When you touch me I just got to say

Baby I love you, baby I love you
Baby I love you, come on baby now
Baby I love you, baby I just love you
It's hard for me to say the things 
I want to say sometimes 
There's no one here but you and me 
And that broken old street light 
Lock the doors 
We'll leave the world outside 
All I've got to give to you 
Are these five words when I 

Thank you for loving me 
For being my eyes 
When I couldn't see 
For parting my lips 
When I couldn't breathe 
Thank you for loving me 
Thank you for loving me 

I never knew I had a dream 
Until that dream was you 
When I look into your eyes 
The sky's a different blue 
Cross my heart 
I wear no disguise 
If I tried, you'd make believe 
That you believed my lies 
 
Thank you for loving me 
For being my eyes 
When I couldn't see 
For parting my lips 
When I couldn't breathe 
Thank you for loving me 

You pick me up when I fall down 
You ring the bell before they count me out 
If I was drowning you would part the sea 
And risk your own life to rescue me 

Lock the doors 
We'll leave the world outside 
All I've got to give to you 
Are these five words when I 

Thank you for loving me 
For being my eyes 
When I couldn't see 
You parted my lips 
When I couldn't breathe 
Thank you for loving me 

When I couldn't fly 
Oh, you gave me wings 
You parted my lips 
When I couldn't breathe 
Thank you for loving me 
You're one in a million 
Oh 
Now 
You're one in a million 
Oh 

Sometimes I can't hate you every day 
Sometimes you can fall for everyone you see 
Only one can really make me stay 
A sign from the sky 
Said to me 

You're one in a million 
You're once in a lifetime 
You made me discover all the stars above us 
You're one in a million 
You're once in a lifetime 
You made me discover all the stars above us 

I've been looking for that special one 
And I've been searching for someone to give my love 
And when I thought that all the hope was gone 
You smile, there you were and I was gone 

I always will remember how I felt that day 
A feeling indescribable to me 
Yeah 
I always knew there was an answer for my prayer 
And you, you're the one for me 

You're one in a million 
You're once in a lifetime 
You made me discover all the stars above us 
You're one in a million 
You're once in a lifetime 
You made me discover all the stars above us 

You're one in a million 
You're once in a lifetime 
You made me discover all the stars above us 
You're one in a million 
You're once in a lifetime 
You made me discover all the stars above us 

I was cool and everything was possible 
You tried to catch me but it wasn't possible 
Nobody could hurt me it was my game 
Until I met you baby and went insane 
And when you didn't want me, I wanted you 
Because the finer thing bout it was I like to go 
I like it when its difficult I like it when it's hard 
You know it's worth it if ya find your heart 

You're one in a million 
You're once in a lifetime 
You made me discover all the stars above us

Try my love again, um ya 
I’m gonna treat you right, um ya 
I’m gonna treat you right
What do the neighbours say
When they hear us scream at night
Do they talk about a love
All in tatters
What do the neighbours know
About the heart and soul
The fire down below
That really matters
They can never guess
In the silences
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane
We got here
All I want is you
I don't want a man
To say "good morning dear"
Let 'em listen at the door
Let 'em listen through the floor
Let 'em go ahead and draw the wrong conclusion
So chase me 'round the room
Make me crazy like the moon
They can never guess
In the silences

That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane that we share
All I want is you
I don't want a man
Who tiptoes up the stairs
All I want is you
And the freight train
Whistling over my track
All I want is you
And your Mack truck loving
Jumping me Jack!
Oh, Jack!

Today I met the boy I am going to marry
He has all I ´ve wantied all my life & even more
He smiled at me & thenl the music started playing
Here is comes the bride when he walked through the door

You told me to take a chance
And learn the way of love, my baby
And all that it had to offer
In time you will see that love won't let you down

You said that you loved me
Said hurt only came to pass me
It sounded so convincing

And oh
I cant do without you for too long, youre my situation
Youre my kinda lover

You got the motions baby

I dont wanna lose ya
You're my kinda lover
Well, I know it's kind of late 
I hope I didn't wake you
But what I got to say can't wait I know you'd understand
Ev'ry time I tried to tell you 
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Yeah, I know it's kind of strange 
But ev'ry time I'm near you 
I just run out of things to say 
I know you'd understand
Ev'ry time I tried to tell you 
The words just came out wrong 
So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Ev'ry time the time was right 
All the words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song 

Yeah, I know it's kind of late
I hope I didn't wake you
But there's something that I just got to say
I know you'd understand
Ev'ry time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong 
So I'll have to say I love you in a song
Too many broken hearts have fallen down the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea
You lay your bets and then you pay the price
The things we do for love
(the things we do for love)

Communication is the problem to the answer
You’ve got her number and your hand is on the phone
The weather’s turned and all the lines our down
The things we do for love
(the things we do for love)

Like walking in the rain and snow
When there’s nowhere to go
And you’re feeling like a part of you is dying
And you’re looking for the answer in her eyes
You think you’re gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up

Ooh, you make me love you
Ooh, you’ve got a way
Ooh, you’ve had me crawling up the wall

Like walking in the rain and snow
When there’s nowhere to go
And you’re feeling like a part of you is dying
And you’re looking for the answer in her eyes
You think you’re gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up

Ooh, you make me love you
Ooh, you’ve got a way
Ooh, you’ve had me crawling up the wall

A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree, but disagree to part
Well after all it’s just a compromise
For the things we do for love
(the things we do for love)
the things we do for love
(the things we do for love)
the things we do for love
(the things we do for love)

In my life there was emptiness
Where I was going I couldn't guess
Then one day into my life you came
And from then on nothing seemed the same
You gave me strength when I thought I could be wrong
Hey now I know right here is
where I belong - with your

Real love to hold on to
Real love to pull me through
And I know with all my heart

Here I'm gonna stay
Here I'll always stay inside your real love

You make things right with no uncertainty
I know this kind of love will always be realized
And I'm now quite sure that
Real love is what we all are looking for
Now I'm ready to be just what you want me to
With you right her to guide me through - I need you

Just to have a soul mate
To make things right when all senses fail
True love is a hard found thing
Now I feel it and I need it always
Close your eyes
make a wish
And blow out the candlelight
For tonight is just your night
We're gonna celebrate

All thru the night
Pour the wine
light the fire
Girl your wish is my command
i submit to your demands
I'll do anything

Girl you need only ask

I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
Till you tell me to

Girl relax
let's go slow
I ain't got nowhere to go
I'm just gonna concentrate on you
Girl are you ready

It's gonna be a long night
Throw you clothes on the floor
I'm gonna take my clothes off too
I made plans to be with you
Girl whatever you ask me

You know I'll do

I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
Till you tell me to

Baby tonight is your night
And I will do you right
Just make a wish on your night
Anything that you ask
I will give you the love of your life

I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go

This magic moment,
so different and so new
Was like any other until I kissed you
And then it happened,
it took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too,
by the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
while your lips are close to mine
Will last forever,
forever till the end of time

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
while your lips are close to mine
Will last forever,
forever till the end of time

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Magic moment
Magic moment
Magic moment
Early in the morning, I'm still in bed
She comes to me with sweet affection
Wakes me with kisses, Hello sleepyhead.
Gets me moving in the right direction
I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everythiung I do I'm doing better

Doing it all for my baby
Because she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

Later in the evening, it's been a busy day
She lays her head upon my weary shoulder
Listen to her laughing, snuggle up and say
Now I'm with you baby, the loneliness is over
I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better

Doing it all for my baby
Because she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

Now I've had the time of my life 
No I never felt like this before 
Yes I swear it's the truth 
And I owe it all to you 
'Cause I had the time of my life 
And I owe it all to you 

I've been waiting for so long 
Now I've finally found someone 
To stand by me 
We saw the writing on the wall 
As we felt this magical 
Fantasy 

Now with passion in our eyes 
There's no way we could disguise it 
Secretly 
So we take each other's hand 
'Cause we seem to understand 
The urgency. 
Just remember 

You're the one thing 
I can't get enough of 
So I'll tell you something 
This could be love because 

I've had the time of my life 
No I never felt this way before 
Yes I swear it's the truth 
And I owe it all to you 

Hey baby

With my body and soul 
I want you more than you'll ever know 
So we'll just let it go 
Don't be afraid to lose control no
Yes I know what's on your mind 
When you say, "Stay with me tonight" (stay with me)
Just remember 

You're the one thing 
I can't get enough of 
So I'll tell you something 
This could be love because 

I've had the time of my life 
No I never felt this way before 
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you 
'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I've searched though every open door
Till I found the truth 
And I owe it all to you 

Now I've (I've) had the time of my life Oooo
No I never felt this way before (Never felt this way)
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you 

I've had the time of my life 
No I never felt this way before 
Yes I swear it's the truth 
And I owe it all to you 
'Cause I've had the time of my life 
And I've searched though every open door
Till I found the truth 
And I owe it all to you
Mama, oh mama, I found that girl
Mama, oh mama, I found that girl

Just like you said it would be with the right situation

The way you explained to me that day
You said only the right girl can make me feel this way

Shes those words left when theres no more to say
Shes more sunshine happy end at a perfect day

The day when you said me upon your knees
You said only the right girl could be all these things

If you wanna be with me, say come on let me know 
Oh baby, whenever you needed me, my love will be right here, 
Oh baby, oh yeah

It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?" 
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight." 

We go to a party and everyone turns to see 
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, "Do you feel all right?" 
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight." 

I feel wonderful because I see 
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all 
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head, 
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light, 
I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight
For all those times you stood by me 
For all the truth that you made me see 
For all the joy you brought to my life 
For all the wrong that you made right 
For every dream you made come true 
For all the love I found in you 
I'll be forever thankful baby 
You're the one who held me up 
Never let me fall 
You're the one who saw me through through it all 

You were my strength when I was weak 
You were my voice when I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when I couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 

You gave me wings and made me fly 
You touched my hand I could touch the sky 
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me 
You said no star was out of reach 
You stood by me and I stood tall 
I had your love I had it all 
I'm grateful for each day you gave me 
Maybe I don't know that much 
But I know this much is true 
I was blessed because I was loved by you 

You were my strength when I was weak 
You were my voice when I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when I couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 

You were always there for me 
The tender wind that carried me 
A light in the dark shining your love into my life 
You've been my inspiration 
Through the lies you were the truth 
My world is a better place because of you 

You were my strength when I was weak 
You were my voice when I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when I couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 

I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 
I'll try to make the sun shine brighter for you 
I will even play the fool if it makes you smile 
I'll make you laugh, if there's a tear in your eye 
Because after all is said 
After all is done 
I'd do anything for you 

Come with me, close your eyes 
Hold my hand, it'll be alright 
Don't be scared, don't be shy 
Lift your head it's gonna be alright 

I'll try to make the stars shine brighter for you 
And I will take you on my shoulders, hold you way up high 
I'll even chase the rainbow hanging in the sky 
Cause after all is said 
After all is done 
I'd do anything for you 

Come with me, close your eyes 
Hold my hand, it'll be alright 
Don't be scared, don't be shy 
Lift your head it's gonna be alright 

Through the eyes of innocence 
You will find, you will see 
There'll come a time it all makes sense 
And you won't know, but it will 
show inside, deep inside 

So come with me, close your eyes 
Hold my hand, it'll be alright 
Don't be scared, don't be shy 
Lift your head it's gonna be alright 

I'll try to make the days last longer for you 
From the daybreak, 'til the sunset, 'til the end of time 
I'll try to keep you safe, away from the heartache 
After all is said 
And After all is done 
I'd do anything for you 

Come with me, close your eyes 
Hold my hand, it'll be alright 
Don't be scared, don't be shy 
Lift your head it's gonna be alright

And when it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

Looking out on the morning rain 
I used to feel uninspired 
And when I knew I had to face another day 
Lord, it made me feel so tired 
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind 
But your love was the key to peace my mind 

Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like 
A natural woman 

When my soul was in the lost-and-found 
You came along to claim it 
I didn't know just what was wrong with me 
Till your kiss helped me name it 
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for 
Cause if I make you happy I don't need no more 

Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like 
A natural woman 

Oh, baby, what you've done to me 
You make me feel so good inside 
And I just want to be close to you 
You make me fell so alive 
Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like 
A natural woman

Some say love it is a river 
That drowns the tender reed 
Some say love it is a razer 
That leaves your soul to blead 

Some say love it is a hunger 
An endless aching need 
I say love it is a flower 
And you it's only seed 

It's the heart afraid of breaking 
that never learns to dance 
It's the dream afraid of wakingthat never takes the chance 
It's the one who won't be taken 
Who cannot seem to give 
And the soul afraid of dyingthat never learns to live 

When the night has been too lonely 
And the road has been too long 
And you think that love is only 
For the lucky and the strong 
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows 
Lies the seed 
That with the sun's love 
In the spring 
Becomes the rose
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It must have been cold there in my shadow,
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

So I was the one with all the glory,
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Did you ever know that you're my hero,
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle,
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed,
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle,
For you are the wind beneath my wings

Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle,
For you are the wind beneath my wings,
'cause you are the wind beneath my wings

Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away You let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

Fly, fly, fly high against the sky,
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you, thank you,
Thank God for you,
The wind beneath my wings
Stay with me,
My love I hope you'll always be
Right here by my side if ever I need you
Oh my love

In your arms,
I feel so safe and so secure
Everyday is such a perfect day to spend
Alone with you

I will follow you will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year

With the dawn,
Oh I see so very clearly now
All my fears are drifting by me so slowly now
Fading away

I can say
The night is long but you are here
Close at hand, oh I'm better for the smile you give
And while I live

I will follow you will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year there will be

I will follow you will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year
Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you theres no one else above you
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles thats what you do

For the morning sun in all its glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort too
You fill my life with laughter

Ease my troubles thats what you do

And its yours and its mine like the sun
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray

Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

You're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fears apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
Touches my foolish heart

Yes you're lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fears apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
Touches my foolish heart

Yes you're lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
Just the way you look tonight
Darling
Just the way you look tonight
I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight 
I've never seen you shine so bright 
I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance 
They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance 
I have never seen that dress you're wearing 
Or the highlights in your head that catch your eyes I have been blind 
The lady in red is dancing with me cheek to cheek 
There's nobody here, it's just you and me, It's where I wanna be 
But I hardly know this beauty by my side 
I'll never for get, the way you look tonight 

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight 
I've never seen you shine so bright you were amazing 
I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side 
And when you turned to me and smiled, It took my breath away 
I have never had such a feeling 
Such a feeling of complete and utter love, as I do tonight 

The way you look tonight 
I never will forget, the way you look tonight 
The lady in red 
The lady in red 
The lady in red 
My lady in red (I love you)

Longer than thereve been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you

Stronger than any mountain cathedral
Truer than any tree ever grew
Deeper than any forest primeval
I am in love with you

I'll bring fires in the winters
Youll send showers in the springs
Well fly through the falls and summers
With love on our wings

Through the years as the fire starts to mellow
Burning lines in the book of our lives
Though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow
I'll be in love with you

Longer than thereve been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than thereve been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you
I am in love with you
Six Years five months

Baby hello, oh no, goodbye
But you got me like a rocket
Shooting straight across the sky

It s the way you love me
Its a feeling like this
Its centrifugal motion
Its perpetual bliss
Its that pivotal moment
Its, ah, impossible
This kiss, this kiss
Unstoppable
This kiss, this kiss

Cinderella said to snow white
How does love get so off course
All I wanted was a white knight
With a good heart, soft touch, fast horse
Ride me off into the sunset
Baby Im forever yours

Its the way you love me
Its a feeling like this
Its centrifugal motion
Its perpetual bliss
Its that pivotal moment
Its, ah unthinkable
This kiss, this kiss
Unsinkable
This kiss, this kiss

You can kiss me in the moonlight
On the rooftop under the sky, oh
You can kiss me with the windows open
While the rain comes pouring inside, oh
Kiss me in sweet slow motion
Lets let everything slide
You got me floating
You got me flying

Its the way you love me
Its a feeling like this
Its centrifugal motion
Its perpetual bliss
Its that pivotal moment
Its (ah) subliminal
This kiss, this kiss
Its criminal
This kiss, this kiss

Do you hear me,
I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my, baby I'm trying
Boy I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard

I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

They don't know how long it takes
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you I promise you, I will

I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
though the breezes through trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
I'm lucky we're in love every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed

Stay my baby
We were both young, when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air

I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns
I see you make your way through the crowd
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said "stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
begging you, "Please don't go..."
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, Oh.

Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said "stay away from Juliet"
but you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes-

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Oh, Oh.

I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say, yes.
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
If I had to live my life without you near me
The days would all be empty
The nights would seem so long
With you I see forever oh so clearly
I might have been in love before
But it never felt this strong
Our dreams are young and we both know
They'll take us where we want to go
Hold me now
Touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by know how much I love you
The world may change my whole life thru but
Nothing'S gonna change my love for you
If the road ahead is not so easy
Our love will lead the way for us
Like a guiding star
I'll be there for you
If you should need me
You don't have to change a thing
I love you just the way you are
So come with me and share the view
I'll help you see forever too
Hold me now
Touch me now
I don't want to live without you
I like the feel of your name on my lips
And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
The way that your fingers run through my hair
And how your scent lingers even when your not there

And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
And how you enjoy your two hour bath
And how you convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching like we were insane

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild
Slow and easy
Heart and soul
So completely
I love the way you love me

I like to imitate old Jerry Lee
And watch you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off key
And I like the innocent way that you cry
At sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild
Slow and easy
Heart and soul
So completely
I love the way you love me

And I could list a million things
I love to like about you
But they all come down to one reason
I could never live without you

I love the way you love me
Strong and wild
Slow and easy
Heart and soul
So completely
I love the way you love me
Oh baby I love the way you love me
If there were no words 
No way to speak 
I would still hear you 

If there were no tears 
No way to feel inside 
I'd still feel for you 

And even if the sun refuse to shine 
Even if romance ran out of rhyme 
You would still have my heart 
Until the end of time 
You're all i need 
My love, my valentine 

All of my life 
I have been waiting for 
All you give to me 
You've opened my eyes 
And showed me how to love unselfishly 

I've dreamed of this a thousand times before 
In my dreams i couldnt love you more 
I will give you my heart 
Until the end of time 
You're all i need 
My love, my valentine 


And even if the sun refuse to shine 
Even if romance ran out of rhyme 
You would still have my heart 
Until the end of time 
Cuz all i need 
Is you, my valentine 

You're all I need 
My love, my valentine 
Tiny hands
Yes that’s you
And all you show
It’s simply true
I smell your breath
It makes me cry
I wonder how
I’ve lived my life

Cause without you
How did I get through
All of my days
Without you
Now living with you
See everything true
My baby it’s you
My baby, my baby, my baby

With no words at all
So tiny and small
In love I fall so deep, so deep
My precious love
Sent from above
My baby boo
Gotta thank you, gotta thank you

Cause without you
How did I get through
All of my days
Without you
Now living with you
See everything true
My Baby it’s you
My baby, my baby, My Baby

Cause without you
How did I get through (How did I get through)
All of my days
Without you
Now living with you
See everything true
My Baby it’s you (My Baby it’s you)
My baby, my baby
Guess this means you're sorry
You're standing at my door
Guess this means you take back
All you said before
Like how much you wanted

Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again

Cuz we belong together now, yea
Forever united here somehow, yea
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life would suck without you

Maybe I was stupid
For telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong
For tryin' to pick a fight
I know that I've got issues
But you're pretty messed up too
Either way I found out I'm nothing without you

Being with you is so disfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you,
But I can't let you go,
Oh yeah

Cuz we belong together now, yea yea
Forever united here somehow, yea
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life would suck without you

Cuz we belong together now,
Forever united here somehow, yea
You got a piece of Me And honestly
My life would suck without you
A lovestruck Romeo, sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, "You and me, babe, how about it?"

Juliet says, "Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack"
He's underneath the window, she's singing 
"Hey, la, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here, singing up people like that
Anyway, what you gonna do about it?"

Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, that you exploded in my heart
And I forget, I forget.. the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet? 

Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
And I dream your dream for you and now your dream is real
How can you look at me, as if I was just another one of your deals?

Well, you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah
Now you just say, "Oh, Romeo, yeah, you know
I used to have a scene with him"

Juliet, when we made love, you used to cry
I said, "I love you like the stars above, I love you 'till I die"
And there's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

I can't do the talk, like the talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you

And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat, and the bad company
And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time

Juliet, when we made love, you used to cry
I said, "I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'till I die"
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet? 

A lovestruck Romeo, sings the streets of serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Find a convenient streetlight, and steps out of the shade
He says something like, "You and me, babe -how about it?"

Only Tiffany, Nancy; that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusin me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin me
Maybe its the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
Cause you was depressed and now you abusin me
That's why I need mea girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit It ruin me
Forget the world girl, it's you and me

Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hoodrat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cellphones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
Cuz now I'm gettin money and the game gettin deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
In the wintertime, full mink, snow white
Anytime we together would feel so right
You the girl I been lookin for my whole life
God blessed me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you girl, now I understand life

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didnt 'preciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Quarter K's, shorty took the whole ride for me
First we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But everytime I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All dem days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss dem pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife

I finally found someone 
That knocks me off my feet 
I finally found the one 
That makes me feel complete 
It started over coffe 
We strated out as friends 
It's funny how from simple things 
The best things begin 

This time is different 
And it's all because of you 
It's better than it's ever been 
'Cause we can talk it though 
My favouite line was 
"Can I call you sometime" 
It's all you had to say 
To take my breath away 

This is it, oh I finally found someone 
Someone to share my life 
I finally found the one 
To be with every night 
'Cause whatever I do 
It's just got to be you 
My life has just begun 
I finally found someone 

Did I keep you waiting? I didn't mind 
I apologise, baby that's fine 
I would wait forever just to know you were mine 

You know I love your hair 
Are you sure it looks right? 
I love what you wear 
Isn't it too tight? 
You're exceptional 
I can't wait for the rest of my life 

This is it, oh I finally found someone 
Someone to share my life 
I finally found the one 
To be with every night 
'Cause whatever I do 
It's just got to be you 
My life has just begun 
I finally found someone 
And whatever I do 
It's just got to be you 
My life has just begun 
I finally found someone
I could start dreamin' but it'd never end 
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend 
I've been dreamin' 
Straight from the heart
You said it's easy but who's to say 
That we'd be able to keep it this way 
But it's easier 

Comin' straight from the heart
Oh, give it to me straight from the heart 
Tell me we can make another start 
You know I'll never go, as long as I know
 
It's comin' straight from the heart
I'll see you on the street some other time 
And all our words would just fall out of line 
While we're dreamin' 

Straight from the heart
Oh, give it to me straight from the heart 
Tell me we can make one more start 
You know I'll never go, as long as I know
 
It's comin' straight from the heart
Straight from the heart 
Tell me we can make one more start 
You know I'll never go, as long as I know 
Give it to me now
Straight from the heart 
Tell me we can make one more start 
You know I'll never go, as long as I know 

It's comin' straight from the heart 
Give it to me, oh no! Oh no!
Straight from the heart 
You know I'll never go, as long as I know 
It's comin' straight from the heart
Love is forever as I lie awake 
Beside you 
I believed there's no heaven 
No hideaway for the lonely 

But I was wrong crazy 
It's gotta be strong 
It's gotta be right 

Only wanted to stay a while 
Only wanted to play a while 
Then you taught me to fly like a bird 

Baby thought I'd died and gone to heaven 
Such a night I never had before 
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven 
Cause what I got there ain't no cure for 

Ooo it's so easy 
What you do to me all night angel 
I never loved, I swear to God 
Never needed no one, 'til you came along 

Here I come baby 
It's gotta be strong, it's gotta be right 
Only wanted to stay awhile 
Only wanted to play awhile 
Then you taught me to fly like a bird 

Baby - thought I'd died and gone to heaven 
Such a night I never had before 
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven 
Cause what I got there ain't no cure for 

I feel fast asleep, I feel drunk 
I dream the sweetest dreams 
Never wanna wake up 

Never thought it could be this way 
No doubt about it, can't live without it 
Never thought it could be this good 
You made love to me, the way it oughta be

What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever keeps me in your arms. 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me. 

Like a rock you waited so patiently, while I got it together. 
While I figured it out, I only looked but I never touched, 
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us: 
Holding hands, making plans, 
And it's lucky for me, you understand. 

What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever keeps me in your arms. 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me. 

A weaker man might have walked away, but you had faith 
Strong enough to move over and understand, while I got it together. 
While I figured it out, they say, "If you love something let it go. 
If it comes back it's yours, and that's how you know. 
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure." 
And you're ready and willing to give me more

What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever keeps me in your arms. 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me. 

Somebody sensitive and tough; 
Somebody there when the going gets rough; 
Every night, he'll be giving his love 
To just one girl, one girl, one. 
Somebody cool but real tender too;
Somebody, baby, just like you 
Can keep me hangin' around with the one who always knew. 
I'm thankin' you for being there for me. 

What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free. 
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, 
Whatever keeps me in your arms.

Hello again, it’s you and me
Kinda always like it used to be
Sipping wine, killin' time
Trying to solve life’s mysteries.

How’s your life, it’s been a while
God, it’s good to see you smile
I see you reaching for your keys
Looking for a reason not to leave.

If you don’t know if you should stay
If you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just, breathe there’s no where else tonight we should be

You wanna make a memory.

I dug up this old photograph
Look at all that hair we had
It’s bittersweet to hear you laugh
Your phone is ringing, I don’t wanna ask.

If you go now, I’ll understand
If you stay, hey, I got a plan

You wanna make a memory

You wanna steal a piece of time
You could sing a melody to me
And I could write a couple lines

You wanna make a memory.

If you don’t know if you should stay
And you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just, breathe there’s no where else tonight we should be

You wanna make a memory

You wanna steal a piece of time
You could sing a melody to me
And I could write a couple lines

You wanna make a memory
You wanna make a memory
I've been really trying baby
Trying to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel baby
Then come on, oh, come on

Oh, let's get it on
Ah, babe, let's get it on
Let's love, baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on
Whoo-ooh-ooh

We're all sensitive people
With so much to give
Understand me, sugar
Since we got to be
Let's live
I love you

There's nothing wrong
With me loving you
Baby, no, no
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true
Oh, babe, ooh, ooh

Don't you know
How sweet and wonderful life can be?
Whoo-oh
I'm asking you, baby
To get it on with me
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I ain't gonna worry, I ain't gonna push
Won't push you, baby
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
Stop beating 'round the bush, hey

Let's get it on, ooh, ooh
Let's get it on
You know what I'm talking 'bout
Come on, baby, hey, hey
Let your love come out
If you believe in love
Let's get it on, ooh, ooh
Let's get it on, baby
This minute, oh yeah
Let's get it on
Please, please, get it on
Hey, hey

I know you know
What I've been dreaming of
Don't you, baby?
My whole body is in love
Oooh

I ain't gonna worry, no, I ain't gonna push
I won't push you, baby, whoo
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, darling
Stop beating 'round the bush, hey

Gonna get it on
Begging you, baby, I want to get it on
You don't have to worry that it's wrong
If the spirit moves you, let me groove you good
Let your love come down
Oh, get it on, come on, baby

Do you know I mean it?
I've been sanctified
Hey, hey
Girl, you give me good feelings, so good

Nothing wrong with love
If you want to love me
Just let yourself go
Oh, baby
Let's get it on

And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Cupid
don't you hear me
calling you
I need you
Cupid
help me
This was an accident
Not the kind where sirens sound
Never even noticed
We´re suddenly crumbling

Tell me how you´ve never felt
Delicate or innocent
Do you still have doubts that
Us having faith makes any sense

Tell me nothing never counts
Lashing out or breaking down
Still somebody loses cause
There´s no way to turn around

Staring at your photograph
Everything now in the past
Never felt so lonely
I Wish that you could show me love

Show me love, show me love, show me love,
show me love, show me love,
Till you open the door

Show me love, show me love, show me love,
show me love, show me love,
Till I´m up off the floor

Show me love, show me love, show me love,
show me love, show me love,
Till it´s inside my pores

Show me love, show me love, show me love,
show me love, show me love,
Till I´m screaming for more

Random acts of mindlessness
Commonplace or occurrences
Chances and surprises
Another state of consciousness

Tell me nothing ever counts
Lashing out or breaking down
Still somebody loses cause
There´s no way to turn around

Tell me how you´ve never felt
Delicate or innocent
Do you still have doubts that
Us having faith makes any sense

You play games, I play tricks
Girls and girls, but you´re the one
Like a game of pick-up-sticks
Played by fucking lunatics

Show me love, show me love
Give me all that I want


Baby its the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
It's gotta be you, uh, huh, uh, huh

Cuz there is only you (ooh, ooh)
Uh, huh, uh, huh
Whoo, whoo, uh, huh, uh, huh

I promise you I will be true, yeah
It's only you
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you.

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love.

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love, yes, it's real love
Oh, it's real love, yes, it's real love

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love.

Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love, yes, it's real love
Oh, it's real love, yes, it's real love

Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love, yes, it's real love
Oh, it's real love, yes, it's real love

Oh, it's real love, yes, it's real love
Oh, it's real love, yes, it's real love
Oh, it's real love, yes, it's real love
Oh, it's real love, yes, it's real love 

Many times I've tried to tell you
many times I've cried alone.
Always I'm surprised how well you cut my feelings to the bone.

Don't wanna leave you really
I've invested too much time.
To give you up that easy to the doubts
that complicate your mind.

We belong to the light
we belong to the thunder.
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under.
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better

We belong
we belong
we belong together.

Maybe it's a sign of weakness when I don't know what to say.
Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway.

Have we become a habit
do we distort the facts.
Now there's no looking forward
now there's no turning back
when you say:

We belong to the light
we belong to the thunder

Close your eyes and try to sleep now

close your eyes and try to dream.
Clear your mind and do your best to try
and wash the palette clean.
We can't begin to know it
how much we really care.
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere.
Still you say :

We belong to the light
we belong to the thunder

We belong to the light
we belong to the thunder

We belong to the light
we belong to the thunder.

There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

But did you know
That when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can be seen

Baby
I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray

Ooh

The more I get of you
The stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray

There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain

My power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?

But did you know
That when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen

Baby
I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray

Ooh, the more I get of you
The stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray

I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
And if I should fall along the way
I've been kissed by a rose
been kissed by a rose on the gray

There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain

My power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah

Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby
But did you know
That when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen

Baby
I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray

Ooh, the more I get of you
The stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray

Yes I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you
The stranger it feels, yeah

And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
Now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray. 
I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie

I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream

And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose

And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you
Everything I gotta tell you
But I know I gotta give it a try

And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules
And I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game

But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it
Making love out of nothing at all

Making love, Out of nothing at all
Making love, Out of nothing at all
Making love, Out of nothing at all
Making love, Out of nothing at all
Making love, Out of nothing at all
Making love, Out of nothing at all

Every time I see you all the rays of the sun
Are streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes like a spotlight

The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright

I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know
Well it's nothing till I give it to you.

I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block

And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn

I can make you every promise that has ever been made
I can make all your demons be gone

But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really want to see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all.

Making love, Out of nothing at all.
Making love, Out of nothing at all.
Making love, Out of nothing at all.
Making love, Out of nothing at all.
Making love, Out of nothing at all.
Making love, Out of nothing at all.
Making love, Out of nothing at all.
Making love, Out of nothing at all.
Making love, Out of nothing at all.
Making love, Out of nothing at all. 
Love me tender
Love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so

Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfilled
For my darling I love you
And I always will

Love me tender
Love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part

Love me tender
Love me dear
Tell me you are mine
Ill be yours through all the years
Till the end of time

When at last my dreams come true
Darling this I know
Happiness will follow you
Everywhere you go)

Thought that I was going crazy
Just having one those days yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out to fill up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight

'Cause baby when I heard you
For the first time I knew
We were meant to be as one

Was tired of running out of luck
Thinking 'bout giving up yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out to fill up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight

'Cause baby when I heard you
For the first time I knew
we were meant to be as one
(to be as one)

Baby when I heard you
For the first time I knew
we were meant to be as one

Everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out and filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight
Love at first sight
Love at first sight
Love
Ooh, it was love, it was love at first sight

'Cause baby when I heard you
For the first time I knew
we were meant to be as one
(to be as one)

'Cause baby when I heard you
For the first time I knew
we were meant to be as one
It was love, it was love, it was love, it was love

Ooh, it was love, it was love, it was love, it was love
Ooh, it was love, it was love, it was love, it was love

I don't know you
But I want you
All the more for that.

Words fall through me
And always fool me
And I can't react.

And games that never amount
To more than they're meant
Will play themselves out.

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time.
Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice
You'll make it now.

Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I can't go back.
Moods that take me and erase me
And I'm painted black.

You have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won.

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time.
Raise your hopeful voice you had a choice
You've made it now.

Falling slowly sing your melody
I'll sing along.
The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go

So won't you say you love me
I'll make you so proud of me

We'll make 'em turn their heads
Every place we go

So won't you please..

(Be my be my baby) Be my little baby
(I want it only say) Say you'll be my darling
(Be my be my baby) Be my baby now
(I want it only say) oh, oh, oh, oh

I'll make you happy, baby
Just wait and see
For every kiss you give me
I'll give you three

Oh, since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you
Till eternity
So won't you please

(Be my be my baby) Be my little baby
(I want it only say) Say you'll be my darling
(Be my be my baby) Be my baby now
(I want it only say) oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


So come on and please
(Be my be my baby) Be my little baby
(I want it only say) Say you'll be my darling
(Be my be my baby) Be my baby now
(I want it only say) oh, oh, oh, oh

(Be my be my baby) Be my little baby
(I want it only say) oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
(Be my be my baby) h-oh-oh, oh
(I want it only say) h, oh, oh, oh, ooh

Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry

Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord
Somebody, somebody

Can anybody find me somebody to love

I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end I take home my hard earned pay all on my own 

I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes

Lord  (somebody  somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

(He works hard)
Everyday, I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down

They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
Yeah  yeah yeah yeah

Oh Lord
Somebody  somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm okay, I'm alright
Ain't gonna face no defeat

I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord

Find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me somebody to love
I go ooh ooh, you go ah ah
la la la la la la la la

I can't lie lie lie lie lie lie
I wanna wanna wanna get get get what I want.

Don't stop
Give me give me give me what you got got
Cause I can't wait wait wait any more more more more.

Don't even talk about the consequence
Cause right now you're the only thing that's making any sense to me
And I don't give a damn what they say, what they think think.

Cause you're the only one who's on my mind
I'll never ever let you leave me.
I'll try to stop time for ever, never wanna hear you say goodbye (bye bye bye).

I feel so untouched..
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you.

I feel so untouched right now
Need you so much somehow
I can't forget you
Been going crazy from the moment I met you.

Untouched
And I need you so much

See you, breathe you, I want to be you
lalalala lalalala
You can take take take take take time time
To live live the way you gotta gotta live your life

Give me give me give me all of you you
Don't be scared
I'll see you through the loneliness of one more more more.

Don't even think about what's right or wrong wrong or right
Cause in the end it's only you and me and no one else is gonna be around
To answer all the questions left behind
And you and I are meant to be so even if the world falls down today

You've still got me to hold you up up
And I will never let you down (down)

I feel so untouched
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you.

I feel so untouched right now

Been going crazy from the moment I met you

Untouched, untouched, untouched

I got chills they're multiplyin'
And I'm losin' control
Cause the power you're supplyin'
It's Electrifyin'

You better shape up 'cause I need a man
And my heart is set on you
You better shape up, you better understand
To my heart I must be true

Nothing left, nothing left for me to do 

You're the one that I want 
(You are the one I want) ooh ooh ooh honey

If you're filled with affection
You're too shy to convey
Meditate in my direction
Feel your way

I better shape up, 'cause you need a man 
(I need a man)

Who can keep me satisfied

(you better prove)

That my faith is justified

I'll be your dream
I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy

I'll be your hope
I'll be your love
Be everything that you need

I love you more with every breath
Truly madly deeply do
I will be strong I will be faithful

'Cause I'm counting on a new beginning
A reason for living
A deeper meaning

I want to stand with you on a mountain
I want to bathe with you in the sea
I want to lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining brightly
In the velvet sky
I'll make a wish
Send it to heaven
Then make you want to cry

The tears of joy
For all the pleasure and the certainty
That we're surrounded
By the comfort and protection of
The highest power
In lonely hours
The tears devour you

I want to stand with you on a mountain
I want to bathe with you in the sea
I want to lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Oh can't you see it baby
You don't have to close your eyes
'Cos it's standing right before you
All that you need will surely come

I'll be your dream
I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy

I'll be your hope
I'll be your love
Be everything that you need

I'll love you more with every breath
Truly madly deeply do

I want to stand with you on a mountain
I want to bathe with you in the sea
I want to lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

I want to stand with you on a mountain
I want to bathe with you in the sea
I want to lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Looking out
Across the nigh time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the night time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say 
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say 
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way

Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say 
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way

I like living this way
I like loving this way

looking out
Across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say 
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why,does he do me that way
If they say 
Why, why, well 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
I Like Living this way 
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
When I want you in my arms
When I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream, dream, dream, dream

When I feel blue in the night
And I need you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream

I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream

I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream


Dream, dream, dream, dream

You are so beautiful to me.
You are so beautiful to me.
Can't you see
You're everything I hoped for.
You're everything I need.
You are so beautiful to me.


You are so wonderful to me.

You are so wonderful to me.


You are so beautiful to me.
You are so beautiful to me.
Can't you see
You're everything I hoped for
You're everything I need.
You are so beautiful to me.


Ooh
Yeah
I'm wishing on a falling star
Wondering where you are
I wish

Wish for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind
In the warm sunshine
She's from the city of angels
Like Betty Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

Met her at a counter affair
She wore a green dress and every body was there
Felt out of place till she looked into my eyes
Shook your hand around nine p.m.

And I, never thought I'd be the same again
Never had to be on a movie screen
To be the lady in all my dreams
Shooby doo-wap and scooby snacks

Met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star
Oh oh
My friends they won't believe me
If they could only see me
At the risk of sounding cheezy
Think i fell for the girl on tv

Wish for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind
In the warm sunshine
She's from, the city of angels
Like Betty Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

Everybody knows her name
Wanna take a picture and their glad she came
But I just want to be there when she's down
Down (Be there when she's down)

I don't want her autograph
I just want to call her up and make her laugh
Never had to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams

Shooby doo-wap and scooby snacks
Met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star
Oh oh

My friends they won't believe me
If they could only see me
At the risk of sounding cheezy
ThinkI fell for the girl on TV

Wish for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do i ever cross your mind
In the warm sunshine

She's from, the city of angels
Like Betty Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

(I wish for you on a falling star)
I'm wishing on a star
And I'm wondering where you are
(wondering where you are)
Do I cross your mind
In the warm sunshine

So I wish for you on a bright shining star
Every where I look there you are
It's the girl in the green dress
She took my breath away
And now i look to the sky
For a better day

To the beach shore and scooby snacks
I met a fly girl and I can't relax
Never had to be on a movie screen
Cause she's the leading lady in all my dreams
I wish

Wish for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind
In the warm sunshine

She's from, the city of angels
Like Betty Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

Wish for you on a falling star
(I wish upon a star)
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind
In the warm sunshine

She's from, the city of angels
Like Betty Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV

I'm wishing
I'm wishing
Mama told me that someday it would happen
But she never said that it would happen like this
Papa said, look out, some girl will catch you nappin'
Some little girl will get to you with her kiss

You got to me
You brought me to my knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine

Used to slip through every girl's hands like water
There never was one who could ever tie me down
Straight ahead and steady as Gibraltar
'Til a lil girl brought me tumblin' to the ground

You got to me
You brought me to my knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine
Alright

You got to me
And brought me to my knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine

You got to me girl
Alright, come on
Said, you got to me now
Where it began, I can't begin to know when
But then I know it's growing strong
Wasn't the spring
And spring became the summer
Who'd believe you'd come along

Hands, touching hands, reaching out
Touching me, touching you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seem so good
I've been inclined to believe they never would

And now I, I look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two

And when I hurt
Hurting runs off my shoulder
How can I hurt when holding you

One, touching one, reaching out
Touching me, touching you
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seem so good
Oh I've been inclined to believe they never would

Sweet Caroline, good times never seem so good 
Girl, you'll be a woman soon

Love you so much can't count all the ways
I'd die for you girl and all they can say is
'He's not your kind'

They never get tired of puttin' me down and
I never know when I come around
What I'm gonna find
Don't let them make up your mind
Don't you know

Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please come take my hand
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Soon, you'll need a man

I've been misunderstood for all of my life
But what they're sayin', girl, just cuts like a knife
'The boy's no good'

Well, I finally found what I've been lookin' for
But if they get a chance they'll end it for sure
Sure they would
Baby I've done all I could it's up to you

Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please come take my hand
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Soon, you'll need a man


Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please come take my hand
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Soon, you'll need a man

Soon, you'll need a man 
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me

Love was out to get to me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried

I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got

What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried

Ah, love was out to get to me
Now, that's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer I couldn't leave her if I tried

Yes, I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
Yes, I'm a believer, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm a believer
Said I'm a believer, yeah
I'm a believer
Said I'm a believer, yeah
I'm a believer

Hello
Again hello

Just called to say hello
I couldn't sleep at all tonight
And I know it's late
But I couldn't wait

Hello
My friend
Hello

Just called to let you know
I think about you every night
When I'm here alone
And you're there at home.
Hello.

May be it's been crazy
And maybe I'm to blame

But I put my heart above my head
We've been through it all

And you loved me just the same
And when you're not there
I just need to hear

Hello
My friend
Hello

It's good to need you so
It's good to love you like I do
And to feel this way
When I hear you say

Hello
My friend
Hello

Just called to let you know
I think about you every night
And I know it's late
But I couldn't wait

Hello
Strolling along country roads with my baby
It starts to rain, it begins to pour

Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin
I feel a shiver run up my spine
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

Ooh, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooh, how I love the rainy days
And the happy way I feel inside

After a while we run under a tree
I turn to her and she kisses me

There with the beat of the rain on the leaves
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes
Sharing our love under stormy skies

Ooh, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooh, how I love the rainy days
And the happy way I feel inside
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

Ooh, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooh, how I love the rainy days
And the happy way I feel inside

Ooh, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooh, how I love the rainy days
And the happy way I feel inside.
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright

People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry cause
Everything's gonna be alright

People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have

I know people will try
Try to divide
Something so real
So till the end of time
I'm telling you that

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

Don't you know that when you touch me baby that it's torture.
Brush up against me I get chills all down my spine.

When you talk to me it's painful.
You don't know what you do to this heart of mine.

But I want you addicted to my perfume.

Our bodies swayin' in time
(In time, in time, in time)

Touching you
So warm and tender

Beautiful is the dream that makes you mine

Girl you are to me, all that a woman should be
And I dedicate my life to you always

The love like yours is grand
It must have been sent from up above
And I know you'll stay this way, for always

And we both know, that our love will grow
And forever it will be you and me

Ooh your life is sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around you bring a brighter day

You're the perfect one
For me and you forever we'll be
And I will love you so for always

Come with me my sweet
Let's go make a family
And they will bring us joy, for always

But you can be sure of course, for always

And we both know, that our love will grow
And forever it will be you and me

For me and you forever we'll be
And I will love you so for always

I will love you so, for always 
As long as you love me

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands

People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head

Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me

Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are, (who you are)
Where you're from, (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me, (I don't know)

Who you are, (who you are)
Where you're from, (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me, (yeah)

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're coming from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are, (who you are)
Where you're from, (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me, (as long as you love me)

Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did, (I don't care)
As long as you love me 
I don't know what he does to make you cry
but I'll be there to make you smile

I don't have a fancy car
to get to you I'd walk a thousand miles

I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know

But if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you but
Love is all I have to give

When you talk  does it seem like he's not
even listening to a word you say

That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them away

Does he leave when you need him the most
Does his friends get all your time

Baby please I'm on my knees
praying for the day that you'll be mine

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you but
Love is all I have to give.


To you hey girl, I don't want you
to cry no more inside

All the money in the world could
never add up to all the love
I have inside I love you

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
But my love is all I have to give


But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you but
Love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you but
Love is all I have to give.

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you but
Love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you but
Love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you but
Love is all I have to give  to you
From the first day that I saw your smiling face
Honey I knew that we would be together forever

When I asked you out, you said no, but I found out
Darling you'd been hurt, you felt that you'd never love again

I deserve a try, honey, just once
Give me a chance, and I'll prove this all wrong

You walked in you were quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die, then live without you
I'll give you all of me, honey that's no lie 

As time goes by you will get to know me
A little more better, girl that's the way love goes

And I know your afraid, to let your feelings show
And I understand, but girl it's time to let go

I deserve a try honey, just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong

You walked in you were so quick to judge
But honey he's nothing like me
Darling why can't you see

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die, then live without you
I'll give you all of me, honey that's no lie 
It's Gonna Be Me (oh, yeah)

You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go (ooh)

I remember you told, me
That it made you believe in
No man, no cry
Maybe that's why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them

Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what, it's gonna be me

You've got no choice, babe
But to move on, and you know
There ain't no time to waste,

Too blind, to see
But in the end you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you

So tell me what to do now 'cause

It's hard to say I'm sorry
It's hard to make the things I did undone

A lesson I've learned too well for sure
So don't hang up the phone now I'm trying to figure out just what to do
I'm going crazy without you

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed (yeah)
So tell me what to do now when I want you back

Baby I remember the way you used to look at me and say
Promises never last forever

When the visions around you
Bring tears to your eyes
And all that surround you
Are secrets and lies

Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call
Was standing here all along

Forever has now begun

Over and over I fall (over and over I fall)
When I hear you call
Without you in my life baby

And I will take (I will take you in my arms)
You in my arms
And hold you right where you belong (right where you belong)

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover

Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know

That's where I'm gonna wait, for you
I'll be lookin' out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay

I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish
(Turn around)
 every now and then I get a
little bit lonely and you're never coming around.

(Turn around)
 Every now and then I get a
little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears.

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a
little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a
little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes

(Turn around bright eyes)
Every now and
then I fall apart

(Turn around bright eyes)
Every now and
then I fall apart

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a
little bit restless and I dream of something wild

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a
little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a
little bit angry and I know I've got to get out and cry

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a
little bit terrified but then I see the look in your eyes

(Turn around bright eyes)
Every now and
then I fall apart

(Turn around bright eyes)
Every now and
then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever

And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
 
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

(Turnaround bright eyes)
(Turnaround bright eyes)

(Turnaround)
Every now and then I know
you'll never be the boy you always you wanted to be

(Turnaround) 
Every now and then I know
you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am

(Turnaround
E)very now and then I know
there's no one in the universe as magical and wondrous as you

(Turnaround)
Every now and then I know
there's nothing any better and there's nothing I just wouldn't do

(Turnaround bright eyes)
Every now and
then I fall apart

(Turnaround bright eyes)
Every now and
then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever

And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line

Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart 
At last

My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

Oh, yeah
At last

The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clovers

The night I looked at you
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own

I found a thrill to rest my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh, yeah when you smile, you smile
Oh, and then the spell was cast

And here we are in heaven
For you are mine

At last

Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Shall I stay
Would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you.

Like a river flows surely to the sea.
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be.

Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows surely to the sea.
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be.

Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

For I can't help falling in love with you 
I will never find another lover sweeter than you,
Sweeter than you

And I will never find another lover more precious than you
More precious than you

Girl you are
Close to me you're like my mother
Close to me you're like my father
Close to me you're like my sister
Close to me you're like my brother
You are the only one my everything and for you this song I sing

And all my life
I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you

All my life
I've prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

I said you're all that I'm thinking of baby
Said, I promise to never fall in love with a stranger

You're all I'm thinking of
I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love I cherish every hug
I really love you

And all my life, baby, baby,
 I've prayed for someone like you,
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you, baby

All my life I've prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me

You're all that I ever known
When you smile, on my face, all I see is a glow
You turned my life around
You picked me up when I was down

You're all that I ever known
When you smile on your face all I see is a glow
You picked me up when I was down
You're all that I ever known

When you smile on your face all I see is a glow
You picked me up when I was down
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes I pray that you do love me too

All my life
I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you

All my life I've prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

All my life I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you

All my life I've prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too 
Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you

It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel

More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real

What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you
More than words

Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me

Hold me close don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real

What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you
More than words 

Oh I cant wait to get next to you
Oh I just can't leave you alone
Boy you got me doing things that I would never do
And I cant stop the way I'm feeling if I wanted to

I'm crazy bout the way that you could make me say your name
And if I couldn't have you I would probably go insane 'cause..

Only u can make me feel 
(Only you can me make me feel)
And only u can take me there 
(Only u can take me there)

And only u can make me feel 
(Only you only you can make me feel)
And only u can take me there 
(Only you can take me there)

Oh I can't wait to get next to you
Oh I just can't leave you alone
Boy you stay inside my mind ain't no denying that

And only you could do them things that got me coming back
Gotta be the realest thing that I have ever felt
And I'll do what I gotta do to keep you to myself 'cause..

Only u can make me feel 
(Only you can me make me feel)
And only u can take me there
(Only u can take me there)

And only u can make me feel 
(Only you can make me feel)
And only u can take me there 
(Only you can take me there)

Crazy
Bout the way you make me feel
I just gotta have u
Here and I
Wanna let u
Know
I wont ever let u
Go

Only u can make me feel 
(Only u can me make me feel)
And only u can take me there 
(Only u can take me there)

And only u can make me feel 
( Only u can make me feel)
And only u can take me there
(Only you can take me there)

Oh I can't wait to get next to you
Oh I just can't leave you alone
There's times when I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete

But you see the colors in me like no one else
And behind your dark glasses you're
You're something else

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best

And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

So many moons that we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better

I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me betta
Betta betta

For real
'Cause underneath it all,
You are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'

Anytime you're around
My body keeps callin'
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'

There's another side to you
And it's a human I adore
Aside from your temper
Everything else secure

Oh no, you're good for me baby
Of that, I'm a sure
'Cause over and over again
Me want more

You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely



You're on the phone with your girlfriend, She's upset
She's going off about something that you said
She doesn't get your humor like I do

I'm in the room, its a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookinf for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walking the streets with you in your worn out Jeans,
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be

Laughing on the park bench thinking to myself,
Hey isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in awhile, since she brought you down

You say you're fine I know you better than that
Hey, What y doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by, waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know that?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're about to cry

I know your favorite songs and you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong. I think I know it's with me.

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by or waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know that
You belong with me
You belong with me

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

This one goes out to you and yours
worldwide

I say hey I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see
the less I know

But I know one thing
That I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

I’ve been a lot of places all around the way
I’ve seen a lot joy and I’ve seen a lot of pain
but I don’t want to write a love song for the world,
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl

Junkies on the corner always calling my name
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down well I hoped it was you
And when I looked into your eyes I knew it was true

I say Hey I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see
the less I know

But I know one thing
That I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

Now I’m not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned
You can bump into person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don’t lose you
‘cause the best luck I had was you

I said Hey I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see the less I know

But I know one thing
That I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

And I said rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I said Hey momma hey momma close to you

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I said hey papa, hey papa close to you

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I said Hey Momma close to you

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you I said,
Hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma
hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma
what you gonna do?

My momma told me don’t lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you
And I know one thing that I love you

I said Hey I'll be gone today
but I’ll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see the less I know

I said Hey I'll be gone today
but I’ll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see the less I know

But I know one thing that I love you
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
Take time to realize
That your warmth is crashing down on in
Take time to realize
That I am on your side
Didn't I, Didn't I tell you

But I can't spell it out for you
No it's never gonna be that simple
No I cant spell it out for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other
And will never find another

Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if
we missed out on each other now

Take time to realize
Oh,oh I'm on your side
Didn't I, didn't I tell you

Take time to realize
This all can pass you by
Didn't I tell you

But I can't spell it out for you
No, its never gonna be that simple
No, I can't spell it out for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other
Then we'd never find another

Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if
We missed out on each other now

It's not always the same
No it's never the same

If you don't feel it too
If you meet me half way
If you would meet me half way
It could be the same for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other
Then we'd never find another

Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder
Just realized what I just realized

Missed out on each other now
Missed out on each other now 
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away

I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want

I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing,
I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong?

I could put my arms round every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor guess what he told me
Guess what he told me

He said girl you better try to have fun
No matter what you do
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted mother
In the backyard
All died when you went away

I know that living with you, baby, was Sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you 

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
My love,
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's bright

My first love,
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I
(I,I,I,I,I)
I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do

And your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Ooh yes, you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts,
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun

Forever
(Ohhh)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And love
Oh, love
I'll be a fool
For you,
I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh, you know I don't mind

'Cause you,
You mean the world to me
Oh
I know
I know
I've found in you
My endless love

Ooh-wow
Boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Oh, and love
Oh, love
I'll be that fool
For you,

I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh you know
I don't mind

And, yes
You'll be the only one
'Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love
My love, my love
My endless love
Dancin' in the dark
Middle of the night
Takin' your heart
And holdin' it tight

Emotional touch
Touchin' my skin
And askin' you to do
What you've been doin' all over again

Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go

It's your love
It just does somethin' to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under
Oh It's your love

Better than I was
More than I am
And all of this happened
By takin' your hand

And who I am now
Is who I wanted to be
And now that we're together
I'm stronger than ever
I'm happy and free

Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in, no
And if you asked me why I changed
All I gotta do is say your sweet name

It's your love
It just does somethin' to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under
oh It's your love

Oh, baby 

Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go

It's your love
It just does somethin' to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under

Oh It's your love
It's your love
It's your love
I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Aaah woah ah ah

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
And through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I want to know what love is
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is
I know you can show me
Aah woah-oh-oh

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me, ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I want to know what love is
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is
I know you can show me
I want to know what love is
I want you to show me

And I want to feel, I want to feel what love is
And I know, I know you can show me

Let's talk about love

The love that you feel inside

I'm feeling so much love

(I want to feel what love is)
No, you just cannot hide

I want to know, I want to know, want know
(I want to feel what love is)
Hey I wanna feel, love
I know you can show me, yeah 
How do I,
Get through the night without you
If I had to live without you,
What kind of life would that be

Oh, I
I need you in my arms, need you to hold,
You're my world, my heart, my soul,
If you ever leave,
Baby you would take away everything good in my life,

And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know,
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go,

How do I ever, ever survive
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live

Without you
There'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me

And I
Baby I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything real in my lif

And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go

How do I ever, ever survive
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live

Please tell me baby
How do I go on

If you ever leave,
Baby you would take away everything
I need you with me

Baby don't you know that you're everything
Real in my life

And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go,

How do I ever, ever survive
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live

How do I live without you

How do I live without you baby
Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take

Baby when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better

I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever

Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark

Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart

Oh it feels like the first time every time
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better

I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever

Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you

Every little thing that you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better

I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever

Every little thing that you do
Oh, every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you

Lying here with you, listening to the rain
Smiling just to see the smile upon your face
These are the moments I thank God that I'm alive

These are the moments I'll remember all my life
I found all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more

Looking in your eyes, seeing all I need
Everything you are is everything to me
These are the moments I know heaven must exist

These are the moments I know all I need is this
I have all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more

I could not ask for more than this time together
I could not ask for more than this time with you
Every prayer has been answered
Every dream I have's come true

And right here in this moment is right where I'm meant to be
Here with you here with me
These are the moments I thank God that I'm alive

These are the moments I'll remember all my life
I've got all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more

I could not ask for more than the love you give me
'Cause it's all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more
I could not ask for more

Unforgettable, that's what you are
Unforgettable though near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me

How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay

That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too

Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too 
Just girl to boy
I'd like to share this
Thought with you
Our love's a joy
Two one's have made inseparable two

Last night my heart spoke to me and
It said you've found
That lover friend

So now I've finally got
The courage just to ask
You baby ooh

Will you, will you
Will you marry me boy
Will you, will you
Will you marry me

Will you, will you
Will you marry me boy
Will you, will
Will you, will you, will you
Come on baby now

I lay awake
So full with hope of things to come

For heaven's sake
I pray I'm not the only one
I never dreamed I'd be so bold

I'm standing here, my
Heart's been sold
So now I've finally got
The courage just to ask
You baby ooh

Think of love as wings
Not a ball and chain
And your fear of things
Unnecessary
I only want to share your name
Share your name

Last night my heart spoke to me and
It said you've found
That lover friend
So now I've finally got
The courage just to ask
You baby ooh

Maybe Sunday
Come on Monday
Baby any time this week

Get an old house
Find a back yard
Buy some flowers down the street

Tell your mother
Tell your father
Don't tell anyone at all

All we need is
Just the two of us

And oh
I'd give anything and everything and I will always care.
Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow,
For better or worse, I will love you with
Every beat of my heart.

From this moment life has begun
From this moment you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on

From this moment I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love I'd give my last breath
From this moment on

I give my hand to you with all my heart
Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment on

You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
From this moment
I will love you as long as I live
From this moment on 
I'll always remember the song they were playing
The first time we danced and I knew
As we swayed to the music and held to each other
I fell in love with you

Could I have this dance for the rest of my life
Would you be my partner then every night
When we're together it feels so right
Could I have this dance for the rest of my life

I'll always remember that magic moment
When I held you close to me
Cause we move together I know forever
You're all I'll ever need

Could I have this dance for the rest of my life
Would you be my partner then every night
When we're together it feels so right
Could I have this dance for the rest of my life

Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love and hold her tight
So happy together

If I should call you up, invest a dime
And you say you belong to me and ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
For all my life

Me and you and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
For all my life

Me and you and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

Me and you and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

So happy together
How is the weather
So happy together
We're happy together
So happy together
Happy together

So happy together

Ooh, now let's get down tonight
Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'

And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing, oh baby

Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual Healing baby, is good for me
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do

I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and
Honey I know you'll be there to relieve me

The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the things you're dealing
I can tell you, darling, that it's Sexual Healing

Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up, let's make love tonight
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 'cause you do it right

Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing is good for me

Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual Healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me

And it's good for me and it's good to me
My baby ohhh
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it

Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great

I can't wait for you to operate
I can't wait for you to operate
When I get this feeling, I need sexual healing
Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home bound

Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by

'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could
Just see you
Tonight

It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder
If you ever
Think of me

'Cause everything's so wrong
And I don't belong
Living in your
Precious memories

'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by

'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could
Just see you
Tonight

And I, I
Don't want to let you know
I, I
Drown in your memory
I, I
Don't want to let this go
I, I
Don't

Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home bound

Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd

And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass us by

'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could
Just see you

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by

'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could
Just see you
If I could
Just hold you
Tonight 
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall yeah fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone could you make it on your own.

If I could, then I would
I'd go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'd go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To-wards you, to guide you, through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall yeah fall upon us all
Well then I hope there's someone out there
who can bring me back to you


If I could, then I would
I'd go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'd go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could, then I would
I'd go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'd go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time
I'd go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'd go wherever you will go
I'd go wherever you will g
If you could give me one good reason
Why I should believe you
Believe in all the things that you tell
I would sure like to believe you

My heart wants to receive you
Just make me know that you are sincere
You know I'd love for you to lead me
And follow through completely

So won't you give me all I ask for
And if you give your very best
To bring me happiness
I'll show you just how much I adore you

'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me

Oh baby, baby, baby, baby,
Baby, cause you mean so much
To me

Now it's gonna take some workin'
But I believe you're worth it
Long as your intentions are good
So good

There is just one way to show it
And boy I hope you know it
That no one could love you like I could
Lord knows I want to trust you
And always how I'd love you

I'm not sure if love is enough
And I will not be forsaken
And I hope there's no mistakin'
So tell me that you'll always be true

'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me

Oh baby, baby, baby, baby,
Baby, cause you mean so much
To me

There's a feeling in my heart
That I know I can't escape
So please don't let me fall
Don't let it be too late

There's a time when words are good
And they just get in the way
So show me how you feel
Baby I'm for real
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me

Oh baby, baby, baby, baby,
Baby, cause you mean so much

Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be

You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For I am here with you

Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms

I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone

You're a falling star, You're the get away car.
You're the line in the sand when I go too far.
You're the swimming pool, on an August day.
And you're the perfect thing to say.

And you play it coy, but it's kinda cute.
Ah, When you smile at me you know exactly what you do.
Baby don't pretend, that you don't know it's true.
'Cause you can see it when I look at you.

And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, You make me sing.
You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.

You're a carousel, you're a wishing well,
And you light me up, when you ring my bell.
You're a mystery, you're from outer space,
You're every minute of my everyday.

And I can't believe, uh that I'm your man,
And I get to kiss you baby just because I can.
Whatever comes our way, ah we'll see it through,
And you know that's what our love can do.


And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, You make me sing
You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.

So, La, La, La, La, La, La, La
So, La, La, La, La, La, La, La


And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, You make me sing.
You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.
You're every song, and I sing along.
'Cause you're my everything.
Yeah, yeah

So, La, La, La, La, La, La, La
So, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La

There are places I remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better

Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall

Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more

Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why'd you have to go-oh
Away from home
Me love.

Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why'd you have to go-oh
Away from home
Me love.


See the first time me looking at your eyes
Me be tell you wants a guy like me -guy like me
We use to have good times on the evening
Me and you chilling on da beach, on the beach

We use to kiss and caress an trust me
Girl it feels so sweet, feels so sweet
Then one day you move
Now I'm feelin' kinda blue
'Cause we had to see you leave -you leave

I feel like I'm drowning in the ocean
Somebody come and take me away


Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why'd you have to go-oh
Away from home
Me love.

Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why'd you have to go-oh
Away from home
Me love.


Now I'm sittin' in a chair with no one here
And I'm feelin' all alone -all alone
Thinkin' to myself like
Damn why my baby up and gone, up and gone
It's like I'm missin' her and I know she's missin' me, missin' me
It's been two years an a half in July will make it three, make it three

I feel like I'm drownin' in da ocean
Somebody come and take me away


Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why'd you have to go-oh
Away from home
Me love.

Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why'd you have to go-oh
Away from home
Me love.


Why you leave me, wh-why you leave me

Baby tell me, ba-baby tell me

I feel like I'm drowning in the ocean
Somebody come and take me away

Away from home
Me love.

Why you leave me, wh-why you leave me
Baby tell me ba-baby tell me
Why you leave me, wh-why you leave me

I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought
Hey, you know, this could be something

'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

So maybe it's true
That I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one

But there's so much time
To figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes
The way you taste
You make it hard for breathing

'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing

That maybe it's true
That I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one

But there's so much time
To figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one


I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought, 
Hey,

Maybe it's true
That I can't live without you
Maybe two is better than one

But there's so much time
To figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking
I can't live without you

'Cause, baby, two is better than one
But there's so much time
To figure out the rest of my life
But I'll figure it out

When all is said and done
Two is better than one
Two is better than one
It started out as a feeling
Which then grew into a hope
Which then turned into a quiet thought
Which then turned into a quiet word

And then that word grew louder and louder
'Til it was a battle cry

I'll come back
When you call me
No need to say goodbye

Just because every thing's changing
Doesn't mean it's never been this way before
All you can do is try to know
Who your friends are as you head off to the war

Pick a star on the dark horizon
And follow the light

You'll come back
When it's over
No need to say goodbye

You'll come back
When it's over
No need to say goodbye

Now, we're back to the beginning
It's just a feeling and no one knows yet
But just because they can't feel it too
Doesn't mean that you have to forget

Let your memories grow stronger and stronger
'Til they're before your eyes

You'll come back
When they call you
No need to say goodbye

You'll come back
When they call you
No need to say goodbye

You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
I have to go, I have to go
Your hair was long when we first met

Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of wonder bread and went Right back to bed
And history books forgot about us and the Bible didn't mention us
And the bible didn't mention us, not even Once

You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the stars came falling on our heads
But they're just old light, they're just old light
Your hair was long when we first met

Samson came to my bed
Told me that my hair was red
Told me I was beautiful and came into my bed
Oh I cut his hair myself one night
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light

And he told me that I'd done alright
And kissed me 'til the mornin' light, the mornin' light
And he kissed me 'til the mornin' light

Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
Ate a slice of wonder bread and went right back to bed

Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down
Yeah we couldn't destroy a single one
And history books forgot about us
And the bible didn't mention us, not even once

You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first

I just might turn into smoke
But I feel fine

Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love

It's coming closer
The flames are now licking my body
and won't you help me
I feel like I'm slipping away
It's hard to breathe
And my chest is a-heaving

Lord have mercy,
I'm burning a hole where I lay
Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
With burning love
Ah, ah, burning love
I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love


A well I bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree

My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah

My hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck

I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah

Please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup

I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah

My tongue get tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have the girl that I love so fine
Hey baby, I ain't askin' much of you
No no no no no no no no baby, I ain't askin' Much of you
Just a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do

Don't be a stingy little mama
You're 'bout to starve me half to death
Well you can spare a kiss or two and
Still have plenty left, no no no

Baby, I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do

You're just a natural born beehive
Filled with honey to the top
Well I ain't greedy baby

All I want is all you got, no no no
Baby, I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do

I got wishbone in my pocket
I got a rabbit's foot 'round my wrist
You know I'd have all the things these lucky Charms could bring

If you'd give me just one sweet kiss, no no no no no no no
Baby, I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do 
You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake sugar,
But you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh

No-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue,
Stick because I'm
Stuck on you

Gonna run my fingers through your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Uh-uh-uh,

Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you

Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch ya and the kissin' starts
A team o' wild horses couldn't tear us apart

Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh

Yes-sir-ee, uh,uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you

It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight

Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait

When I first saw you
With your smile so tender
My heart was captured
My soul surrendered

I'd spend a lifetime
Waiting for the right time
Now that your near
The time is here at last

It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight

Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait

Just like a willow
We would cry an ocean
If we lost true love
And sweet devotion

Your lips excite me
Let your arms invite me
For who knows when
We'll meet again this way

It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight

Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait
Honey, I love you too much
Need your lovin' too much
Want the thrill of your touch

Gee, I can't hold you too much
You do all the livin'
While I do all the givin'
Cause I love you too much

You spend all my money too much
Have to share you honey, too much
When I want some lovin', you're gone

Don't you know you're treatin' me wrong
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken hearted
'Cause I love you too much

Every time I kiss your sweet lips
I can feel my heart go flip flip
I'm such a fool for your charms

Take me back baby in your arms
Like to hear you sighin'
Even though I know you're lyin'
Cause I love you too much

Need your lovin' all the time
Need you huggin', please be mine
Need you near me, stay real close

Please, please, hear me, you're the most
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me brokenhearted
Cause I love you too much 
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true

Just call my name
And I'll be right by your side
I want your sweet helping hand
My loves too strong to hide

Always lived, very quiet life
I ain't never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long

One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true

Always lived a very quiet life
I ain't never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long

One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true


She rolls the window down
And she
Talks over the sound
Of the cars that pass us by
And I don't know why
But she's changed my mind

Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
I'm crazy for this girl

She was the one to hold me
The night
The sky fell down
And what was I thinking when
The world didn't end
Why didn't I know what I know now

Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel

And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
I'm crazy for this girl

Right now
Face to face
All my fears
Pushed aside
And right now
I'm ready to spend the rest of my life
With you

Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel

And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
I'm crazy for this girl


Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel

And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
I'm crazy for this girl
Ridin' in the drop top with the top down
Saw you switchin' lanes girl
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right

Come here, let me get your name girl
Tell me where you from, what you do, what you like

Let me pick your brain girl
And tell me how they got that pretty little face on that pretty little frame girl

But let me show you 'round, let me take you out
Bet you we could we could have some fun girl

'Cause we can do it fast (fast), slow, whichever way you wanna run girl
But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings

Do it how you want it done girl
And who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

Come on and lemme show you 'round
Let me take you out, bet you we could have some fun girl
'Cause we can dress it up, we can dress it down

Any way you want it done girl
Or we can stay home, talkin' on the phone
Rappin' 'til we see the sun girl
Do what I gotta do, just gotta show you that I'm the one girl

Well I'mma freak you right, each and every night
I know how to do it insane girl

'Cause I can make it hot, make it stop
Make you wanna say my name girl
Come on baby please 'cause I'm on my knees

Can't get you off my brain girl
But who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

The summer's over for the both of us
But that doesn't mean we should give up on love
You're the one I've been thinking of
And I knew the day I met you you'd be the one

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

Let me set the mood right
'Cause I'm gonna make you feel alright
Let me set the mood right
'Cause I'm gonna make you feel alright

Gotta set the mood right
And that may make you feel alright
I'm gonna set the mood right
I promise baby you値l feel alright

Just let me set the mood right
And that may make you feel alright
I'm gonna set the mood right

And you will say my name tonight
If I set the mood right
Promise girl you値l feel alright
If you let me set the mood right
I値l make you feel so good tonight

If it feels good to you then it値l feel good to me
Let me set the mood right 
You're better then the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler then the flip side of my pillow, that's right

Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me,
Lets me know that it's okay, yeah it's okay
And the moments where my good times start to fade

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking the sidewalk crack and just like that
You steal away the rain and just like that

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Don't know how I lived without you
'Cause every time that I get around you
I see the best of me inside your eyes
You make me smile

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile 
Just something about you
The way I'm lookin' at you whatever
You keep lookin' at me
You gettin' scared now, right?
Don't fear me baby, it's just destiny
It feel good right?
Listen


I kind of noticed, from one night
From the club, your front face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face will change


If you smiling, that should set the tone
Just be limber
If you let go, the music should groove your bones
Just remember
Sing this song with me


Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you


People are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?

They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
Cause we're here tonight


If you smiling, that should set the tone
Just be limber baby
If you let go, the music should groove your bones
Baby just remember
Sing this song with me



Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you


Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance
To be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance
To be your man
Here baby, put on my jacket
And then 


Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl 


Ma, what chu wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low

From them you heard "Wow, it's the same glow"
Look at me, I say "Yeah, it's the same dough"
We the same type, you my air of life
You have sleepin' in the same bed, er'night


Go rock with me, you deserve the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We could ride down

Pumpin N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play this free, joint called "brain"
Ma, take a hint
Make me swerve in the lane

The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?


Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl


Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust you
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

Break this down

You know, I used to dream about this when I was a
little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, 
It's kind of special right? yeah
You know, you think about it

Sometimes people just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now everybody dance. 
Ain't another woman that could take your spot my

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me
(What would you do?)

If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular?
(Tell me would you?)

Well baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl
(Like you)

This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
(Say I do)

Because I could see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our clothes in the sand
I could see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side

You could be my baby
When I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be

My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot

My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love, my love, my love

Now if I wrote you a love note
And made you sign up every word I wrote
(What would you do?)

Would that make you want to change your scene
And want to be the one on my team?
(Tell me would you?)

See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl, I never been more sure
(That baby, it's you)

This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for
(Just say it, I do)
Because..

I could see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our clothes in the sand
I could see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side

You could be my baby
When I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be

My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot

My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love, my love, my love

Shorty cool as a fan
On the new once again
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan

Hey listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can

'Cause the girls real wild, throw they hands up high
When they wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy
You don't really wanna let a chance go by
Because you ain't been seen wit a man so fly

Baby France so fly, I can't go fly
Private 'cause I handle my BI
They call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire

I hate to have to cancel
My vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go, why?
Me and your boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, you decide just that I ain't your guy

I ain't gonna lie, I feel your space
Then forget your face, I swear I will
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me a pair, I will

I could see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our clothes in the sand
I could see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side

You could be my baby
When I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin? crazy
See all I want you to do is be

My love, love
My love, love
My love, love
Ain't another woman that can take your spot

My love, love
My love, love
My love, love
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love, my love, my love

Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do
Baby, you spin me around
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground

Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see

You drive me crazy
I just cant sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue
That I'm not wasting, my feelings on you


You drive me crazy
I just cant sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night


Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Every Day and Every Night


You drive me crazy
I just cant sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night


You Drive Me Crazy (You drive me crazy baby)
Oh crazy, but it feels alright
Baby thinking of you keeps me up all night
Baby thinking of you keeps me up all night 
I'm sitting here alone up in my room
And thinking about the times that we've been through (oh my love)

I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand

I really want to know what we did wrong
With a love that felt so strong
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right


I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy

Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd better give it up and carry on (oh my love)
'Cause living in a dream of you and me
Is not the way my life should be

I don't want to cry a tear for you
So forgive me if I do
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy

Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

I'd do anything, I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever, to be your girl
Just call out my name, and I will be there
Just to show you how much I care

I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy

Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face

A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me

The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight girl its only you and me

Everything I know, and anywhere I go
It gets hard but it wont take away my love
And when the last one falls
When it's all said and done
It gets hard but it wont take away my love

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight girl its only you and me

Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me

Don't ever let me find you gone
'Cause that would bring a tear to me

This world has lost its glory,
Let's start a brand new story now,
My love.

Right now, 
There'll be no other time and I can show
You how, 
My love.

Talk in everlasting words, 
And dedicate them all to me.
And I will give you all my life
 
I'm here if you should call to me.
You think that I don't even mean a single Word I,
Say

It's only words, 
And words are all I have to take,
Your heart away
I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me in my mind


How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
never fall again

Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right

So here we are alone again'
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again

Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do
Love you
Again 
Ooh baby, oh oh
All I want is you

Baby, I've tried but I can't help myself
Can't disguise the way I feel inside
I'm falling so helplessly it's true, yeah

I close my eyes and believe completely
That I can feel you touching my skin
So tenderly,
Come morning light just the victim of fantasy

Every time I close my eyes
You just disappear you say goodbye
Baby, I'd do anything to make you mine
Oh, it's true

All I want is you
(I'll give my heart and soul)
All I want is you
(I'll be there when you call)
All I wanna do
(is make love to you)
All I want is you, all I want is you

I can't sleep 'til the last star leaves the sky
With every beat of my heart
I wanna make you mine
I'm praying you feel the same way too
Tell me that you hear my call tonight

Oh you can bring this dream to life
Baby, I'd do anything to make you mine
Oh, it's true

All I want is you
(I'll give my heart and soul)
All I want is you
(I'll be there when you call)
All I wanna do
(is make love to you)
All I want is you, all I want is you

All you gotta do is believe in me you'll find sanctuary
Just one chance is all I need to prove that You and I Are for ever meant to be

(All I want is you)
(All I want is you)
(All I want is you)
(All I want is you)

All I want is you
All I wanna do is
(make love to you)
All I want is you, all I want is you

Baby, I'll give my heart and soul
(I'll give my heart and soul)
Give my heart and soul
(I'll be there when you call)

All I wanna do
(is making love to you)
Oh you know it's true
All I want is you, all I want is you

All I want is you
(I'll give my heart and soul)
All I want is you
(I'll be there when you call)
All I wanna do
(is make love to you)
All I want is you, all I want is you 
Hiding from the rain and snow
Trying to forget but I won't let go
Looking at a crowded street
Listening to my own heart beat

So many people all around the world
Tell me where do I find someone like you girl


Take me to your heart take me to your soul
Give me your hand before I'm old
Show me what love is - haven't got a clue
Show me that wonders can be true

They say nothing lasts forever
We're only here today
Love is now or never
Bring me far away

Take me to your heart take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is - be my guiding star
It's easy take me to your heart

Standing on a mountain high
Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
I should go and see some friends
But they don't really comprehend

Don't need too much talking without saying anything
All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing

Take me to your heart take me to your soul
Give me your hand before I'm old
Show me what love is - haven't got a clue
Show me that wonders can be true
This Romeo is bleedin'
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up

It's been rainin' since you left me
Now I'm drownin' in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I'll give up

I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
I guess I'm not that good anymore
But that's just me

I will love you baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day
Always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye

What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
Touch your lips and hold you near
When you say your prayers understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

When he holds you close, he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him with these words of mine
To say to you till the end of time

That I will love you baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day
Always

If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

I will love you baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day
Always

I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and words don't rhyme
And I know when I die you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you always
Candle light and soul forever
A dream of you and me together
Say you believe it, say you believe it

Free your mind of doubt and danger
Be for real don't be a stranger
We can achieve it, we can achieve it

Come a little bit closer baby, get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

Silly games that you were playing
Empty words we both were saying
Let's work it out boy, let's work it out boy

Once again if we endeavor
Love would bring us together
Take it or leave it, take it or leave it

Are you as good as I remember baby, 
Get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one


Ah, oh wow
Ah, oh wow

Be a little bit wiser baby, put it on, put it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya baby)

I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

It's the only way to be
It's the only way to be


Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line

Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Oh you and me girl
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
Then my life..I can see beyond forever

Everything we are will never die
Loving's such a beautiful thing
Oh you make my world.. a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line

Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

You and me girl got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night and day
And the tears you had to cry
You're my life

I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we are will never die
Loving's such a beautiful thing
When you are to me, the light above
Made for all to see our precious love

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line

Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Love is such a beautiful thing
You make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line

Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river and harder to cross

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line

Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go

When we're gray and old
'Cause I have been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold

So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel the love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong

And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows

She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong

And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong

And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead 
Give me time to reason,
give me time to think it through
Passing through the season,
where I cheated you

I will always have a cross to wear,
but the bolt reminds me I was there

So give me strength,
to face this test tonight

If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time
I would stay for the night. 
For the night

Claim your right to science
Claim your right to see the truth
Though my pangs of conscience,
Will drill a hole in you

I seen it coming like a thief in the night
I seen it coming from the flash of your light

So give me strength
To face this test tonight

If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time
I would stay for the night

The bolt reminds me I was there
the bolt reminds me I was there

If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time
I would stay for the night

I feel it in my fingers

I feel it in my toes
The love that's all around me
You know I love you

I always will

My mind's made up by the way what I feel.
There's no beginning

There'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend

And so the feeling grows
It's written on the wind

It's everywhere I go

So if you really love me
Come and let it show.

I see your face before me
As I lay on my bed
I cannot get to thinking

Of all the things you said
you gave your promise to me
And I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me
In everything I do

I got to keep it moving
It's written in the wind
Oh everywhere I go

So if you really love me
Come and let it show.

Come on and let it show.
Come on and let it

Come on and let it

Come on and let it show
You said you believed that we'd
Find love together happily
After all the wrong I've done

You feel that I'm still the one
To give your loving to
So bring it home to you


You told me that you'd love me if I'd ever change
Welcome me into your arms again
Come on in out of the rain, hey

There's a place in your heart to love me again
Happiness and joy you bring
When you call my name
Come on in out of the rain


I loved no one but you
But I strayed, I know I made you blue
You spoke unto my very soul
You warmed my heart that once was cold
Now I'm so glad to know


You told me that you'd love me if I'd ever change
Welcome me into your arms again
Come on in out of the rain, hey

There's a place in your heart to love me again
Happiness and joy you bring
When you call my name
Come on in out of the rain


Some people spend a lifetime looking for love
And I had love right here all the time
Why did I try to deny it

Deep inside I just couldn't fight it
You turned my life around
The love I lost is found
So let the rain come down


You told me that you'd love me if I'd ever change
Welcome me into your arms again
Come on in out of the rain, hey

There's a place in your heart to love me again
Happiness and joy you bring
When you call my name
Come on in out of the rain


(Come on in out of the rain)
Oooo-oh-ooo, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come on in out of the rain)

When the time gets near for me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for hiding from a word

I need to hear now don't think I'll hear it again
But the nights were always warm with you
holding you right by my side,

But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes

All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again someday

All I do each night is think of all the times
I close the door to keep my love within

If you can't forgive the past I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights okay I'll regret it

I never showed you my love
But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes

All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think of all the times
I close the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight of the dream we long to live
If you stop and close your eyes you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone, straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think of all the times
I close the door to keep my love within
Babe, come in from the cold and put that coat to rest.
Step inside, take a deep breath, and do what you do best.

Yes, kick off them shoes and leave those city streets.
I do believe love came our way, and fate did arrange for us to meet.

I love when you do that hocus pocus to me.
The way that you touch, you've got the power to heal.
You give me that look, it's almost unreal. It's almost unreal.

Hey, we can't stop the rain, let's find a place by the fire.
Sometimes I feel, strange as it seems,
you've been in my dreams all my life.

I love when you do that hocus pocus to me.
The way that you touch, you've got the power to heal.
You give me that look, it's almost unreal. It's almost unreal.

It's a crazy world out there. It's a crazy
Let's hope our prayers are in good hands tonight.

Oh, I love when you do that hocus pocus to me.
The way that you touch, you've got the power to heal.
You give me that look, it's almost unreal.
It's almost unreal, so unreal.

Yea come on and do that hocus pocus to me.
The way that you touch, you've got the power to heal.
You give me that look, it's almost unreal. It's almost unreal, yea.

It's almost unreal. Do that hocus pocus to me. Do that hocus pocus

The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
as I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body and feel each move you make.
Your voice is warm and tender

A love that I could not forsake.
'Cause I am your lady and you are my man.
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can.
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms

When the world outside's too much to take -
That all ends when I'm with you.
Even though there may be times
it seems I'm far away

But never wonder where I am 'cause I am always by your side.
'Cause I am your lady and you are my man.
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can.

We're heading for something
somewhere I've never been

Sometimes I am frightened
but I'm ready to learn 'bout the power of love !
The sound of your heart beating
made it clear suddenly.

The feeling that I can't go on is light-years away.
'Cause I am your lady and you are my man

We're heading for something
somewhere I've never been

Sometimes I am frightened
but I'm ready to learn 'bout the power of love!
Ooh
the power of love
the power of love.
Sometimes I am frightened
but I'm ready to learn 'bout the power of love 
I'd say love was a magical thing
I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had I been there, had I been there

I would promise you all of my life
But to lose you would cut like a knife
So I don't dare, no I don't dare

'Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared, I'm so scared

Take me back in time maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care

I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
Little by little you've brought me to my knees
Don't you care

No I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
I'm so scared of this love

And if all that there is, is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could, I would, I swear


Well, I can't forget this evening
And your face when you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

Well, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know


I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

Well, I can't forget this evening
And your face when you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows



I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore


I can't live, if living is without you.
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

A strangled smile fell from your face
It kills me that I hurt you this way
The worst part is that I didn't even know
Now there's a million reasons for you to go
But if you can find a reason to stay

I'll do whatever it takes
To turn this around
I know what's at stake
I know that I've let you down
And if you give me a chance
Believe that I can change
I'll keep us together whatever it takes

She said,
 If we're gonna make this work
You gotta let me inside even though it hurts
Don't hide the broken parts that I need to see

She said,
 Like it or not it's the way it's gotta be
You gotta love yourself if you can ever love me

I'll do whatever it takes
To turn this around
I know what's at stake
I know that I've let you down
And if you give me a chance
And give me a break
I'll keep us together, I know you deserve much better

But remember the time I told you the way that I felt
That I'd be lost without you and never find myself
Let's hold onto each other above everything else
Start over, start over

I'll do whatever it takes
To turn this around
I know what's at stake
I know I've let you down
And if you give me a chance
and believe that I can change
I'll keep us together whatever it takes

I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with every day
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you

I'm not a perfect person
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

I've found a reason to show
A side of me you didn't know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you
The dawn is breaking
A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you, yeah

I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find you and I collide

I'm quiet you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know
I'm always on your mind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find you and I collide

Don't stop here
I lost my place
I'm close behind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find you and I collide

You finally find you and I collide
You finally find you and I collide

Come away with me in the night
Come away with me
And I will write you a song

Come away with me on a bus
Come away where they can't tempt us
With their lies

I want to walk with you
On a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
So won't you try to come

Come away with me and we'll kiss
On a mountaintop
Come away with me
And I'll never stop loving you

And I want to wake up with the rain
Falling on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms
So all I ask is for you
To come away with me in the night
Come away with me


To kiss and tell
It's just not my style
But the night is young
And it's been a while
And she broke my heart
Broke it right in two

And it's fixing time
But I'm feeling like I'm finally ready to
Find, find somebody new
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight

And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far
Just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

It's that moment when
You start closing in
First you're holding back
Then surrendering

It can start a fire
Light up the sky
Such a simple thing
Do you wanna try

Are you ready to
Say goodbye
To all these rules

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight

Don't wanna go too far
Just to take it slow,
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world

I wanna kiss a girl
'Cause, baby, tonight
It could turn into the rest of our lives
Oh yeah

Are you ready
(Are you ready)
Are you ready
(Are you ready)
To cross that line
Put your lips on min
Put your lips on mine, baby

Do you wanna try
Are you ready to
Say goodbye
To all these rules

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
And maybe make a little magic, baby

Don't wanna go too far
Just to take it slow
I don't want to be lonely
I shouldn't be lonely

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight

Don't wanna go too far
Just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

I said I wanna kiss a girl
Whoa-ho whoa-ho
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
I wanna make a little magic
Out under the moonlight

Ooh I wanna kiss her now
Have mercy, baby on a poor girl like me,
You know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet

I'm tingling right from my head to my toes
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go

'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
Then you woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Have pity baby
Just when I thought it was over
Now you got me running, running, running for cover
I'm begging you for a little sympathy
'and if you use me again it'll be the end of me

'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
Then woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Don't wanna talk about it
Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna think about it anymore

Baby, baby, hope you're gonna stay away
'Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker everyday
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around

Then woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Say that you love me
say that you love me

Fallin' fallin' fallin
Fallin' fallin' fallin


All I know is the way that I feel
Whenever you're around
You've got a way of lifting me up
Instead of bringing me down

I can't fight it anymore
Since you've been around
We've got love in store

You're the only one I ever felt
Could be special to me
You look at me and I just melt
I'm scared of feeling that way

I can't fight it anymore
Since you've been around
We've got love in store

Never take your love away
Beggin' you baby
Never take your love away
Oh darlin'
Never take your love away
Beggin' you baby
Never take your love away

I can't fight it anymore
Since you've been around
We've got love in store



I've been searching
For a pot of gold
Like the kind you find
At the end of the rainbow

I've been dreaming
Thought it was in vain
Ah, but now you're here
Can't believe that you're back again

Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow
As long as you follow

I've been wandering
Gone away too far
But the road was rough
To get back where you are

And the sun went down
It never seemed to rise
Ah, but now you're here
With the light shining in your eyes

Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm gonna win (I'm gonna win)
I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow
Yes, I can live today
If you give me tomorrow
As long as you follow


Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm gonna win (I'm gonna win)
I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow
Yes, I can live today
If you give me tomorrow

As long as you follow
As long as you follow
(As long as you follow)
As long as you follow
(As long as you follow)
As long as you follow

(As long as you follow)
(As long as you follow)
(As long as you follow) 
I'm not surprised
Not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times I stopped keeping track

Talk myself in
I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down

I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I thought of every possibility

And I know someday that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet


I might have to wait
I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing
And the other half's luck

Wherever you are
Whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility


But somehow I know that it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

They say all's fair
In love and war
But I won't need to fight it
We'll get it right and
We'll be united

And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility

And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you, kid, I'll give more than I get
Than I get, than I get, than I get

Oh
You know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, to give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I just haven't met you yet
Ohh, promise you, kid, to give so much than I get.

(I said love, love, love, love)
I just haven't met you yet

I just haven't met you yet.
Well I lost my heart on the day we met
But I gained a lot that I don't regret
Then I hung around till you said I do
I knew I wouldn't have nothin'
If I didn't have you


Well it changed my thinking
When you changed your name
And neither one of us will ever be the same
And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue
'Cause I wouldn't have nothin'
If I didn't have you


If I didn't have you I'd long ago
Been left in the dark out in the cold
Blowing around from town to town
Like a feather in the wind

If I didn't have you I know I'd be
Floundering around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane
That's where I'd have been


But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light
Shining like a beacon on a cold dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No I wouldn't have nothing
If I didn't have you


Well I count my blessings every night I pray
That the Lord lets me keep you just one more day
And every day He does 'cause God knows too
That I wouldn't have nothing
If I didn't have you


f I didn't have you I'd long ago
Been left in the dark out in the cold
Blowing around from town to town
Like a feather in the wind

If I didn't have you I know I'd be
Floundering around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane
That's where I'd have been

But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light
Shining like a beacon on a cold dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No I wouldn't have nothing
If I didn't have you

Well I've already said it but I swear it's true
I know I wouldn't have nothing
If I didn't have you
Come with me my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you

Come with me
To the sea, of love

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you

Come with me
To the sea, of love

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you

I want to tell you
How much I love you
I want to tell you
How much I love you

All my life was a paper once plain, 
Pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changin' moods now and then
Till the balance was right

Then you added some music, 
Every note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in Me by the look on my face

And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams area apart
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life

Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song
There was no harmony life meant nothin' to Me, until you cam along

And you brought out the colors, 
What a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be Shinin' soft in your eyes

And you decorated my life, 
Created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life

I know it's late,
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me

Still here we are,both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see

Why should we worry, 
No one will care, girl
Look at the stars now so far away

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow
We've got tonight baby
Why don't you stay

Deep in my soul,
I've been so lonely
All of my hopes, fading away

I've longed for love, 
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching,
After today

So that there it is girl
We've got it all now
And here we are baby
What do you say

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow
We've got tonight baby
Why don't we stay

I know it's late,
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me

Still here we are,
both of us lonely
both of us lonely

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow
Let's make it last
Let's find a way

Turn out the light
Oh, oh come take my hand now

We've got tonight baby
Why don't you stay
We've got tonight baby 
Why don't you stay
When the morning sun streaks across my Room
And I've waken up from another dream of you
Yes I'm on the road, once again it seems
All I've left behind is a chain of broken dream

But you know I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you

How I wish that love is all we need to live
What a life we'd live 'cause I've got so much To give
And it seems so wrong, 
Deep inside my heart
That the dollar sign could be keeping us apart
When you know I love
Yes I love you

And if I could only find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life of mine didn't cross our minds
All the answers were found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you, I'd come running back to you

But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Just to pay the rent, I must leave you all alone
But you know I made my choice many years Ago
And this traveling life is the only one I know

But you know, I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you
But you know, I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you

But you know, I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you
But you know, I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you

But you know, I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you
But you know, I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you


Show me a bar with a good lookin' woman Then just get out of my way
Turn on the jukebox, 
I'll show you a song you should play

Sooner or later, a few shots of bourbon,
I'll think of somethin' to say, whoa,
I can take her or leave her but
I like to take her away

Liquor and music, a good combination
If you've got love on the brain.
I never knew two women who acted the same.

Some want a drink first and some want to just sit and talk.
Whoa, oh, it's two in the morning, 
I'm running and she wants to walk

Something's got a hold on me
It's cheap but it ain't free
Love or somethin' like it's got a hold on me.

That's when I asked her,
My place or your place,
I hope I'm not out of line.
I asked the wrong thing,

But just the right woman this time.
She knew a hotel
She even had a name we could sign
Whoa, oh, the cheaper the grapes are
The sweeter the taste of the wine

Something's got a hold on me
It's cheap but it aint free
Love or somethin' like it's got a hold on me

Something's got a hold on me
It's cheap but it ain't free
Love or somethin' like it's got a hold on me
Love or somethin' damn near like it's got a hold on me
Well she walks like you in so many ways
It's a different look
It's a different time of day
One look in her eyes

How can I make you understand
She's the one good thing that's happened in So many years

There's been so many tears
When we lost the dream
And the winter came
And you said goodbye
And I don't want another reason to cry

You be all you wanna be
You got the longest night
Baby, be alone
I share my dream with someone else
I don't wanna talk about her

This woman she's tearing my world apart
This woman don't know what she's doing
This woman touches me and I lose control

She's living inside my soul

This woman I don't even know her name
This woman don't know what she's doing
This woman goes through me like a hurricane
Falling in love again

To make those long legs mine is all I care About
She's got so much to give I got to be the one
I got to have
Someone to hold

I got to make it with that woman
When the nights get hot
And she goes walking by
And the city lights, and the city lights
They make you blind

I go insane
But am I crazy if she feels the same
You believe what you believe
You got the darkest night

Baby , be alone
I take my love to someone else
She was made to measure for me

You be all you wanna be
You got the longest night
Baby , be alone
I share my dream with someone else
I don't wanna talk about her

This woman she's tearing my world apart
This woman don't know what she's doing
This woman touches me and I lose control

She's living inside my soul

This woman I don't even know her name
This woman don't know what she's doing
This woman goes through me like a hurricane
Falling in love again

For you I give a lifetime of stability
Anything you want of me, nothing is impossible
For you, there are no words or ways to show my love
Or all the thoughts I'm thinking of

Cause this life is no good alone
Since we've become one
I've made a change
Everything I do now, makes sense
All roads end, all I do is for you

For you I share the cup of love that overflows
And anyone who knows us knows
I would change all faults I have,

For you there is no low or high or in between
Of my heart that you haven't seen
'Cause I share all I have and am
Nothing I've said's hard to understand

All I feel I feel deeper still, and always will
All this love is for you

Every note that I play, every word I might say
Every melody I feel
Are only for you and your appeal

Every page that I write, every day of my life
Would not be filled with without the things
That my love for you now brings

For you I make the promise of fidelity
Now and for eternity
No one could replace this vow

For you, I'd take take your hand heart And everything
And add to them a wedding ring
Cause this life is no good alone

Since we've become one you're all I've known
And if this feeling should leave, I'd die
And here's why, all I am is for you

Everything I do now makes sense
All roads end, all I do,
Is for you
La da da dee da da da da

Be my lover, wanna be me lover

Looking back on all the time we spent together

Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Fall in love again


Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again


I could never see
What fate had planned for me
And then you came
And made a dream
My reality

Maybe you can't see
All the things you've lead to me
Well my simple fate is at the gate
And boy, you've got the key


Ohhh yeh

It seems like yesterday
you and I first loved this way
But now I know
How love can grow

With each and every day
As we lay at midnight hour
And feel loves hidden power
So strong and bold as life
Unfolds the mystery to me


I never dream
That my summertime
Flame could show me
How much pleasure
The winter can bring

Hooked up by the fireplace
Time I don't waste
As I love you slow
Then increase the pace

Your natural body perfume
Brightens up any room
One whiff and my spirits taken up-lift

It feels good
When your woman is your best friend
But it's better
When you fall in love again
You know I've been waiting so long for this chance
Can we talk alone

But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute

Little lady you look so fine
Can't turn my eyes away
So much I wanna say, and
Tonight I wanna make you mine

We'll turn the lights down low
And dance so very slow
I know that we don't know each other well
But I can't believe I'm wasting your time, 
Oh no

So tell me what to do
For the love of you tonight


'Cause I've been holding back what I feel
Love's so real
But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute

'Cause I've been holding back all I feel
I'm for real
'Cause I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute for your love

Your love
No
No no baby

Sweet lady
Don't you look away
I don't mean to make you shy
But we haven't got much time

Tonight I know just what to say, yeah
I'll love your cares away
And you and I will find a way
You know that there's a possibility

That we'll never get this chance once again, Oh no
So tell me what to do
For the love of you tonight
Baby tonight


'Cause I've been holding back what I feel love's so real
But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute

'Cause I've been holding back all I feel
I'm for real
'Cause I can't wait another minute 
(oh no I can't)
I can't wait another minute for your love

Your love
Oh yeah

I know that we don't know each other well
But I can't believe I'm wasting your time, oh no
So tell me what to do for the love of you
Tonight
Tonight baby


'Cause I've been holding back what I feel
Love's so real
But I can't wait another minute 
(I can't wait)
I can't wait another minute

'Cause I've been holding back all I feel
I'm for real
'Cause I can't wait another 
(wait another)

I can't wait another minute
For your love
(I can't wait another minute)
(Not another minute baby)

But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute
'Cause I've been holding back all I feel
I'm for real

'Cause I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute for your love
Oh no


Don't make me wait another minute
Oh no baby

For your love
She's a woman
She's a baby
She's a witch
She's a lady

She's a free and gentle spirit
She can be what she wants to be
And if she wants to be with me tonight
That's alright

She's one hell of a woman
Young, strong and tame
But soft when she loves me
Like a gentle kitten in my hand

She makes me feel
Like a hell of a man
She's wild, warm and tender
She'll resist then she'll surrender

She's a free and gentle spirit
She can be what she wants to be
And if she wants to be with me tonight
Well that's alright

She's one hell of a woman
Young, strong and tame
But soft when she loves me
Like a gentle kitten in my hand

She makes me feel
Like a hell of a man
She's one hell of a woman
Young, strong and tame

But soft when she loves me
Like a gentle kitten in my hand
She makes me feel
Like a hell of a man
I’ve heard people say that
Too much of anything
Is not good for you baby

But I don’t know about that
As many times as we’ve loved
Shared love and made love

It doesn’t seem to me
Like it’s ever, ever enough
It’s just not enough

My darling, I, can’t get enough of your love babe
I don’t know I don’t know I don’t know why
I can’t get enough of your love babe

Oh some things I can’t get used to
No matter how I try
It’s like the more you give the more I want
And baby that’s no lie, oh no babe

Tell me what can I say
What am I gonna do
How should I feel, when everything is you you you

What kind of love is this
That you’ve given me
Is it in your kiss or just because you’re sweet

All I know is every time you’re near
I feel a change
Something’s moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing

My darling, I, can’t get enough of your love babe
I don’t know I don’t know I don’t know why
I can’t get enough of your love babe

Oh some things I can’t get used to
No matter how I try
It’s like the more you give the more I want
And baby that’s no lie, oh no babe

Tell me what can I say
What am I gonna do
How should I feel, when everything is you you you

What kind of love is this
That you’ve given me
Is it in your kiss or just because you’re sweet
All I know is every time you’re near
I feel a change

Something’s moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing


If I could make you see
And make you understand
Your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand
Oh well babe

How can I explain
All the things I feel
You’ve given me so much

You’re so unreal, unreal, unreal
Still I keep loving you
More and more each time
What am I gonna do

Cause you’ve blown my mind
I get the same old feeling
Every time you’re near
I feel a change

Something’s moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing

Can’t Get Enough Of Your Love 
I'll always love you for the rest of my days
You have won my heart and my soul with your sweet, sexy ways
You gave me hope when I needed someone near
You bring me happiness every day of every year.

I'll always love you for all that you are
You have made my life complete, you're my lucky star
You are the one that I've been searching for
You are my everything, tell me who could ask for more

And I'll always love you, Honey, this will never end
I need you by my side, baby, you're my lover,my friend
My friend

You gave my world a thrill I've never known
And filled my eager heart with a love to call my own

And I'll always love you, you must know how much I do
You can count on me forever and I will take good care of you

I'll always love you, I'm so happy that you're mine
I'll always love you, yes, till the end of time
I keep getting closer to the love I know
I’m ready and willing getting out of control
You win and you lose some
But if you stay in the game

Before you know it you feel the fire
But don’t get burned by the flame
You’ll find the answer any day

With every beat of my heart
I keep getting closer to you
With every beat of my heart
I know we’re getting closer
To love with every beat

I just wanna know you more every day
And it won’t be long till I hear you say say it say it
Say that you do boy
It’s just a matter of time

Before you know it you’ll feel the fire
And it’s burning deep inside
You’ll find the answer in his eyes

With every beat of my heart
I keep getting closer to you
With every beat of my heart now
I know I’m getting closer to love

With every beat of my heart
I feel you moving closer to me oh
With every beat of my heart
Baby I know it’s becoming reality
With every beat
If I,
I get to know your name

Well I could trace your private number
baby.
All I know is that to me you look like you're lots of fun

Open up your loving arms
I want some
want some.

Well I,
I set my sights on you and no one else will do.
And I
I've got to have my way now
baby.
All I know is that to me you look like you're having fun

Open up your loving arms
watch out
here I come.

You spin me right round
baby
right round

Like a record
baby
right round
round
round.
You spin me right round
baby
right round

Like a record
baby
right round
round
round.

I,
I got to be your friend now
baby

And I,
Would like to move in just a little bit closer.
All I know is that to me you look like you're lots of fun

Open up your oving arms
watch out
here I come.

You spin me right round
baby
right round

I want your love
I want your love.
All I know is that to me you look like you're lots of fun

Open up your loving arms
watch out
here I come.

You spin me right round
baby
right round
I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny, but when you're near me
(I'm in the mood for love)

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh, is it any wonder
(I'm in the mood for love)

(Why stop to think of whether)
(This little dream might fade)
(Let's put our hearts together)
Now we are one, I'm not afraid

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain, we'll let it
But, for tonight, forget it
(I'm in the mood for love)

(Why stop to think of whether)
(This little dream might fade)
(Let's put our hearts together)
Now we are one, I'm not afraid

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain, we'll let it
But, for tonight, forget it
I'm in the mood
Hope you're in the mood
For love
My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't she make me proud
She never makes a scene
By hanging all over me in a crowd

'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know she'll be leaving with me

And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no-one knows what goes on behind closed doors

My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't she make me smile
She's never far away
Or too tired to say: "I want you"

She's always a lady, just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights
She's still a baby to me

'Cause when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man

Oh, no-one knows what goes on behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

I can hear the neighbors
They're arguing again
And there hasn't been peace on our street
Since who knows when

I don't mean to listen in
But the shoutin' is so loud
I turn up the radio to drown it out
And silently I say a little prayer

But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love

And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God

I can see that old man
He's walking past our door
And I've been told that he's rich

But he seems so poor
'Cause no one comes to call on him
And his phone it never rings
He wanders through his empty home
Surrounded by his things

And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do

But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love

And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God

I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God

Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God


Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry, why do I let myself worry
Wondering what in the world did I do
Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you

I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you
Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you

I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you.
Whisper to me softly, breathe words upon my skin.
No one's near and listening, so please, don't say goodbye.

Just hold me close and love me, press your lips to mine.
mm, mm, mm, feels so right.
Feels so right.

Lying here beside you, I hear the echos of your sighs.
Promise me you'll stay with me and keep me warm tonight.

So hold me close and love me, give my heart a smile.
mm,mm, mm, feels so right.
Feells so right.

Your body feels so gentle, and my passion's rising high.
You're loving me so easy, your wish is my command.

Just hold me close and love me, tell me it won't end.
mm, mm, mm, feels so right.

Feels so right.
Feels so right.
You may think that I'm talking foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you always will be

But your not just time that I'm killing
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live, this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die

Oh baby I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather

As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again

I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever amen


They say time takes its toll on a body
Makes a young girls brown hair turn gray
Honey I don't care I ain't in love with your hair

And if it all fell out well I'd love you anyway
They say time can play tricks on a memory

Make people forget things they knew
Well it's easy to see it's happening to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you

Oh darlin' I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men

If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
Just listen to how this song ends
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever amen

I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever amen
I did everything I could to get you here tonight
Without telling you why
Now girl if you only would, 
Please hold out your hand

Just close your eyes
I've been dying to ask you one burning question
Will you be mine

From here to eternity
I'm asking you to share your life with me
Now and forever I guarantee, 
I'll always stay by your side

I promise my love to you
I'm willing and able and ready to
Whatever you need
I am here for you, and I'll always be
From here to eternity

I saved a year for this ring
I can't wait to see
How it looks on your hand

I'll give you everything that one woman needs
From a one woman man
I'll be strong I'll be tender a man of my word
I will be yours.

From here to eternity
I'm asking you to share your life with me
Now and forever I guarantee, I'll always stay by your side

I promise my love to you
I'm willing and able and ready to
Whatever you need

I am here for you, and I'll always be
From here to eternity
Once in every life
Someone comes along
And you came to me
It was almost like a song

You were in my arms
Right where you belong
And we were so in love
It was almost like a song

January through December
We had such a perfect year
Then the flame became a dying ember
All at once you weren't here

Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And It's almost like a song
But it’s much too sad to write

Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And It's almost like a song
But it’s much too sad to write

It's too sad to write
I've held it all inward, 
God knows, I've tried,
But it's an awful awakening in a country boy's life,
To look in the mirror in total surprise.
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes.

Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.

It's a measure of people who don't understand,
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band.
I got my first guitar when I was fourteen,
Well I finally made forty, still wearing jeans.

Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.

Once in every life
Someone comes along
And you came to me
It was almost like a song

You were in my arms
Right where you belong
And we were so in love
It was almost like a song

January through December
We had such a perfect year
Then the flame became a dying ember
All at once you weren't here

Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And It's almost like a song
But it’s much too sad to write

Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And It's almost like a song
But it’s much too sad to write

It's too sad to write
It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads

By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads

By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind

But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind 
	



Every now and then soft as breath upon my skin
I feel you come back again
And it’s like you haven’t been gone a moment from my side,

Like the tears were never cried,
Like the hands of time were pulling you and me.

And with all my heart I’m sure we’re closer than we ever were,
I don’t have to hear or see I’ve got all the proof I need.
There are more than angels watching over me

I believe
Oh I believe

Now when you die and life goes on, I
t doesn’t end here
When you’re gone every soul has found a flight
It never ends if I’m right.

Our love can even reach across eternity.

I believe
Oh I believe

Forever you’re a part of me,
Forever in the heart of me,
I will hold you even longer if I can.

Oh the people, who don’t see the most,
See that I believe in ghosts.
If that makes me crazy then I am

'Cause I believe
Oh I believe

There are more than angels watching over me.

I believe
Oh I believe

Every now and then soft as breath upon my skin,
I feel you come back again
And I believe. 
I'm no poet and I know it
I don't use five dollar words
This might not sound like much
Compared to all the pretty things you've heard

But here's how I'd explain it
Since you brought it up
It won't sound like anybody else's version of love

It's like just before dark
Jump in the car
Buy an ice cream
And see how far we can drive before it melts
Kind of feeling
That's how your love makes me feel inside

There's a cow in the road
And you swerve to the left
Fate skips a beat and scares you to death
And you laugh until you cry
That's how your love makes me feel inside

It might not be suitable for greeting cards and such
It's a true and honest feelin'
And if you feel it half as much
We can go through life together
Without a worry or a care

Knowing deep down in our hearts
That we've got somethin' special here

It's like just before dark
Jump in the car
Buy an ice cream
And see how far we can drive before it melts
Kind of feeling
That's how your love makes me feel inside

There's a cow in the road
And you swerve to the left
Fate skips a beat and scares you to death
And laugh until you cry
That's how your love makes me feel inside
That's how your love makes me feel

I have always heard you can't put love into words

It's like just before dark
Jump in the car
Buy an ice cream
And see how far we can drive before it melts
Kind of feeling
That's how your love makes me feel inside

There's a cow in the road
And you swerve to the left
Fate skips a beat and scares you to death
And laugh until you cry
That's how your love makes me feel inside
That's how your love makes me feel


That's how you love makes me feel inside
That's how your love makes me feel inside
That's how I feel
That's how your love makes me feel
That's how I feel
I don't believe in superstars, organic food and foreign cars
I don't believe the price of gold, 
The certainty of growing old

That right is right and left is wrong,
That north and south can't get along
That east is east and west is west 
And being first is always best

But I believe in love
I believe in babies 
I believe in mom and dad 
And I believe in you

I don't believe that heaven waits, 
For only those who congregate
I like to think of God as love
He's down below he's up above

He's watchin' people everywhere 
He knows who does and doesn't care
And I'm an ordinary man 
Sometimes I wonder who I am

But I believe in love 
I believe in music 
I believe in magic 
And I believe in you

Well I know with all my certainty 
What's going on with you and me is a good thing
It's true I believe in you

Well I don't believe virginity, 
Is as common as it used to be
In working days and sleeping nights 
That black is black and white is white

That Superman and Robin Hood are still alive in Hollywood
That gasoline's in short supply the rising cost of gettin' by

But I believe in love 
I believe in old folks 
I believe in children 
And I believe in you

I believe in love 
I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad 
And I believe in you
Those happy hours that we once knew,
Though long ago, still make me blue.
They say that time heals a broken heart.
But time has stood still since we've been apart.

I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of old lone-some times.

I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say.
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday.

Those happy hours that we once knew,
Though long ago, still make me blue.
They say that time heals a broken heart.
But time has stood still since we've been apart.

I can't stop loving you,
There's no use to try.
Pretend there's some one new;
I can't live a lie.

I can't stop wanting you
The way that I do.
There's only been one love for me,
That one love is you.
Our love is unconditional, 
We knew it from the start.
I see it in your eyes, 
You can feel it from my heart.

From here on after let's stay the way we are right now,
And share all the love and laughter
That a lifetime will allow.

I cross my heart and promise to
Give all I've got to give 
To make all your dreams come true.
In all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine.

You will always be the miracle that makes my life complete,
And as long as there's a breath in me, 
I'll make yours just as sweet.

As we look into the future,
It's as far as we can see,
So let's make each tomorrow be the best that it can be.

I cross my heart and promise to
Give all I've got to give to make all your dreams come true.
In all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine.

And if along the way we find a day it starts to storm,
You've got the promise of my love to keep you warm.

In all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine,
A love as true as mine. 
I've seen the storm clouds in your past
But rest assured 'cause you are safe
At home at last

I rescued you, you rescued me
And we're right where we should be
When we're together

I know the questions in your mind
But go ahead and ask me one more time
You'll find the answer's still the same
It won't change from day to day
for worse or better

Will I promise to be your best friend
And am I here until the end
Can I be sure I have been waiting for you
And did I say my love is true
Baby I will, I am, I can, I have, I do

I know the time will disappear
But this love we're building on will always be Here
No way that this is sinking sand
On this solid rock we'll stand forever


Baby I will, I am, I can, I have
Oh, I will, I am, I can, I have
Baby I will, I am, I can, I have, I do

When you light those candles
Up there on that mantle, setting the mood
Well, I just lie there staring
Silently preparing to love on you

Well, I can feel the heat from across the room
Ain't it wild what a little flame can make you wanna do

I melt every time you look at me that way
It never fails, anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

Don't know how you do it
I love the way I lose it, every time
What's even better
Is knowing that forever you're all mine

The closer you get, the more my body aches
One little stare from you is all it takes

I melt every time you look at me that way
It never fails, anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

I melt every time you look at me that way
It never fails, anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

(I melt)
I melt

Every time you look at me that way

(I just melt)
I melt
(I just melt)
I melt
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line 
There's a lot of ways of saying
What I wanna say to you
There's songs and poems and promises
And dreams that might come true

But I won't talk of starry skies
Or moonlight on the ground
I'll come right out and tell you
I'd just love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
A woman loves to hear

I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around
Oh, darlin', how I'd love to lay you down

There's so many ways your sweet love's
Made this house into a home
You've got a way of doing
Little things that turn me on

Like standing in the kitchen
In your faded cotton gown
With your hair all up in curlers
I still love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
A woman loves to hear

I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down

When a whole lot of Decembers
Are showin' in your face
Your auburn hair has faded
And silver takes it's place

You'll be just as lovely and I'll still be around
And if I can't I know that
I'd still love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
A woman loves to hear

I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
My woman loves to hear

I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around
Oh, darlin' how I love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
My woman loves to hear

I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around


When I look into your soft green eyes
When I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress

I'm reminded what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh

Then I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you

Me in the rain or the wind
Or the moon up in the sky
The spin of the earth or the change of the tide

I don't know what brought us together
What strange forces of nature
Conspire to construct the present
From the past

Then I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
Yeah, yeah
Ooh it's a love thing

I been working all day long
And I'm ready to come on home to you
All the other guys roll their eyes
And don't realize it's what I want to do

It's what I want to do
They say I'm wrapped around your finger
But they don't understand
That what we got is more than just a diamond
On your hand

Baby it's a love thing, whoa
Baby it's a love thing, yeah

Sure I could hang around and complain about
The way things ought to be
Yeah there's trouble in the world

But you're the girl
Whose open arms are all I really need
And that's why I come runnin'
To be there by your side
So let 'em call me crazy
But it can't be denied

Baby it's a love thing, whoa
Baby it's a love thing, yeah

And it's not about the same last name
It's not a thing that can be explained
It's how you make me feel inside
And the way you hold me every night

It's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby, it's a love thing, yeah

Here we go now
It's a love thing

They say I'm wrapped around your finger
But they don't understand
That what we got is more than just a diamond
On your hand

Baby it's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah
Come on it's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby, It's a love thing, yeah

Oh, it's a love thing, whoa
Oh sugar, it's a love thing
No it ain't about no diamond ring
It's a love thing, whoa

Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah
It's a love, it's a love, it's a love thing
If you wanna drive a big limousine
I'll buy the longest one you've ever seen
I'll buy you tall, tall trees and all the waters in the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you

If you wanna own a great big mansion
Well I'll give it my utmost attention
I'll buy you tall, tall trees and all the waters in the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you

Well I'm a fool over you
It may take a while but I'll prove it's true
Well if it's loving you want well I've got it
If it's money you want the I'll get it

I'll buy you tall, tall trees and all the waters in the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you

If you wanna take a trip across the ocean
I'll travel anywhere you take a notion
I'll buy you tall, tall trees and all the waters in the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you

If you wanna own a great mansion
Well I'll give it my utmost attention
I'll buy you tall, tall trees and all the waters in the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you

Hey I'm a fool over you
It may take a while but I'll prove it's true
Well if it's loving you want then I've got it
If it's money you want well I'll get it

I'll buy you tall, tall trees and all the waters in the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you

Yeah I'm a fool, fool, fool for you
It was no accident me finding you
Someone had a hand in it
Long before we ever knew

Now I just can't believe you're in my life
Heaven's smilin' down on me
As I look at you tonight

I tip my hat to the keeper of the stars
He sure knew what he was doin'
When he joined these two hearts

I hold everything
When I hold you in my arms
I've got all I'll ever need
Thanks to the keeper of the stars

Soft moonlight on your face oh how you shine
It takes my breath away
Just to look into your eyes

I know I don't deserve a treasure like you
There really are no words
To show my gratitude

So I tip my hat to the keeper of the stars
He sure knew what he was doin'
When he joined these two hearts

I hold everything
When I hold you in my arms
I've got all I'll ever need
Thanks to the keeper of the stars

It was no accident me finding you
Someone had a hand in it
Long before we ever knew
Whenever I chance to meet
Some old friends
In the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way

I've always got a smiling face
Anytime and any place
And every time they ask me why
I just smile and say

You've got to
Kiss an angel good morning
And let you know you think about her when you're gone

Kiss an angel good morning
and love her like the devil when you get back home

Well people may try to guess
The secret of a happiness
but some of them never learn it's a simple thing

The secret I'm speaking of
Is a woman and a man in love
and the answer is in this song
that I always sing

You've got to
Kiss an angel good morning
And let you know you think about her when you're gone

Kiss an angel good morning
and love her like the devil when you get back home

Kiss an angel good morning
And let you know you think about her when you're gone

Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home
Baby I've been drifting away
Dreaming all day
Of holding you
Touching you

The only thing I want to do
Is be with you
As close to you
As I can be

Let's make love
All night long
Until all our strength is gone

Hold on tight
Just let go
I want to feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Let's make love

Oh, baby

Do you know what you do to me
Everything inside of me
Is wanting you
And needing you
I'm so in love with you

Look in my eyes
Let’s get lost tonight
In each other

Let's make love
All night long
Until all our strength is gone

Hold on tight
Just let go
I want to feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Let's make love

Let's make love
All night long
Until all our strength is gone

Hold on tight
Just let go
I want to feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Oh, until the sun comes up
Let's make love

Oh baby, let's make love
All night long
Let’s make love


I read a note my grandma wrote back,
In nineteen twenty-three.
Grandpa kept it in his coat, 
And he showed it once to me. 

He said:
Boy, you might not understand, 
But a long, long time ago,
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I loved your Grandma so.

We had this crazy plan to meet, 
And run away together.
Get married in the first town we came to, 
And live forever.

But nailed to the tree,
Where we were supposed to meet, 
Instead of her, 
I found this letter, and this is what it said:

If you get there before I do, 
Don't give up on me.
I'll meet you when my chores are through
I don't know how long I'll be.

But I'm not gonna let you down, 
Darling wait and see.
And between now and then, 
Till I see you again,
I'll be loving you. 

Love, me.

I read those words just hours 
Before my Grandma passed away,
In the doorway of a church where me and Grandpa stopped to pray.

I know I'd never seen him cry 
In all my fifteen years;
But as he said these words to her, 
His eyes filled up with tears.

If you get there before I do, 
Don't give up on me.
I'll meet you when my chores are through;
I don't know how long I'll be.

But I'm not gonna let you down, 
Darling wait and see.
And between now and then, 
Till I see you again,
I'll be loving you. 
Love, me.

Between now and then, till I see you again,
I'll be loving you. Love, me.

Ordinary no, really don't think so
Not a love this true
Common destiny
We were meant to be
Me and you

Like a perfect scene from a movie screen
We're a dream come true
Suited perfectly for eternity
Me and you

Every day, I need you even more
And the night time too
There's no way
I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to

Every day I live
Try my best to give
All I have to you
Thank the stars above
That we share this love Me and you

Every day, I need you even more
And the night time too
There's no way
I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to

Ordinary no, I really don't think so
Just a precious few
Ever make it last
Get as lucky as
Me and you
Me and you


A woman is a mystery
A man just cant understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand

And Other times you got to take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong


Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
And Lean into my kiss
And close those deep blue need you eyes

Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby I must be doin' somethin' right

Anywhere you wanna go
Baby show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Mmm whatever you say

Tonight's about givin' you what you want
Whatever it takes
Girl I hope I'm on the right road

Judgin' by the smile on your face
Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
And Lean into my kiss
And close those deep blue need you eyes

Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby I must be doin' somethin' right

Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
And Lean into my kiss
And close those deep blue need you eyes

Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby I must be doin' somethin' right

Hands that are strong, but wrinkled
Doing work that never gets done.
Hair that's lost some of the Beauty,
By too many hours in the Sun.

Eyes, that show some disappointment
And there's been quite a lot in her life.
She's the foundation I lean on,

My Woman, My Woman, My Wife

Everyday has been uphill,
We've climbed but we can't reach the top.
I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged
She just smiles when I want to stop.

Lips, that are weary but tender,
With love that strengthens my life.
A seine and a dress made of Gingham

My Woman, My Woman, My Wife

Two little Babies, were born in the Spring,
But died when the Winter was New.
I lost control of my mind and my Soul
But my Woman's Faith, carried us through.

When she reaches that River,
Lord you know what she's worth.
Give her that mansion up yonder,
'Cause she's been through hell here on Earth.

Lord give her my share of Heaven
If I've earned any here in this life.
'Cause I believe she deserves it,
My Woman, My Woman, My Wife

So many times
These few dreams of mine
Seem hidden behind

A mountain too high to climb
But you were the one
Who said,
Go on, follow your star

When the song in my heart
Was just a voice in the dark
You could hear my mellow key

There's only one moon
That shines in the night
And only one love in my life

Only one love in my life,
Only one love in my life
I'm a ship on the open ocean darling
You're my guiding light

The radio played
My new song today
And I heard someone say
Man, he sure got it made

If only they knew how much you
Have made of me
Together we came
From nowhere to fame
And I never could have made it
Alone

For me there's only one moon
That shines in the night
And only one love in my life

Only one love in my life,
only one love in my life
I'm a ship on the open ocean
darling, you're my guiding light

Only one love in my life,
only one love in my life
I'm a ship on the open ocean
darling, you're my guiding light
yeah

you're my guiding light
and you're the only love in my life


I can't imagine, any greater fear
Than waking up, without you here,
And though the sun, would still shine on,
My whole world, would all be gone,
But not for long,

If I had to run, if I had to crawl
If I had to swim a hundred rivers, just to climb a thousand walls,

Always know that I would find a way, to get to where you are,
There's no place that far

It wouldn't matter why we're apart,
Lonely miles or two stubborn hearts
Nothing short of God above
Could turn me away from your love
I need you that much

If I had to run, if I had to crawl
If I had to swim a hundred rivers, just to climb a thousand walls,

Always know that I would find a way, to get to where you are,
There's no place that far

If I had to run, if I had to crawl
If I had to swim a hundred rivers, just to climb a thousand walls,

Always know that I would find a way, to get to where you are,
There's no place that far

Baby there's no place that far


Last night I had a crazy dream
A wish was granted just for me
It could be for anything

I didn't ask for money
Or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished, for one more day with you

One more day
One more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied

But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still, for one more day with You

First thing I'd do, 
Is pray for time to crawl
Then I'd unplug the telephone
And keep the TV off

I'd hold you every second
Say a million I love you's
That's what I'd do, with one more day with you

One more day
One more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied

But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still, for one more day with you

Leave me wishing still, for one more day
Leave me wishing still, for one more day 
I like blue eyes, hers are green
Not like the woman of my dreams
And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned

Five foot three isn't tall
She's not the girl I pictured at all
In those paint by number fantasies I've had

So it took me by complete surprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was looking for
She's more

No, it wasn't at first sight
But the moment I looked twice
I saw the woman I was born to love

Her laughter fills my soul
And when I hold her I don't wanna let go
When it comes to her I can't get enough

So it took me by complete surprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was looking for
She's more

More than I dreamed of
More than any man deserves
I couldn't ask for more
Than a love like hers

So it took me by complete surprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was looking for
She's more
There's a new wind blowin' 
Like I've never known.
I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done.
And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do.

I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.

An' I'm lettin' go of all my lonely yesterdays.
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've Made.
Now there's just one thing, 
The only thing I wanna do, mm, mm.

I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.

Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine,
Shinin' down on me and you.
When you put your arms around me,
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do.

I used to run in circles goin' no where fast.
I'd take, uh, one step forward and two steps back.
Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to, mm, mm.

I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.

Whoa here we go now

Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine,
Shinin' down on me and you.
When you put your arms around me,
Well, baby there ain't nothing in this world I can't do.

Sometimes it's hard for me to understand,
But you're teachin' me to be a better man.
I don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do, no, no.

I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.

I'm ready to love somebody,
Love somebody like you. Ooh.

An' I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you, yeah.

Oh yeah.
Oh, I wanna be the man in the middle of the Night,
Shinin' like it's true.
I wanna be the man that you run to Whenever I call on you

When everything that loved someone finally found it's way
Wanna be a better man
I see it in you yeah
I remember well the day we wed
I can see that picture in my head
I still believe the words we said
Forever will ring true

Love is certain, love is kind
Love is yours and love is mine
But it isn't something that we find
It's something that we do

It's holding tight, lettin' go
It's flying high and laying low
Let your strongest feelings show
And your weakness, too

It's a little and a lot to ask
An endless and a welcome task
Love isn't something that we have
It's something that we do

We help to make each other all that we can Be
Though we can find our strength 
And inspiration independently

The way we work together is 
What sets our love apart
So closely that you can't tell where I 
End and where you start

It gives me heart remembering how
We started with a simple vow
There's so much to look back on now
Still it feels brand-new

We're on a road that has no end
And each day we begin again
Love's not just something that we're in
It's something that we do

We help to make each other all that we can Be
Though we can find our strength
And inspiration independently

The way we work together 
Is what sets our love apart
So closely that you can't tell where I end 
And where you start

Love is wide, love is long
Love is deep and love is strong
Love is why I love this song
And I hope you love it too

I remember well the day we wed
I can see that picture in my head
Love isn't just those words we said
It's something that we do

There's no request too big or small
We give ourselves, we give our all
Love isn't someplace that we fall
It's something that we do
I'm not the hero who will always save the day
Don't always wear the white hat 
Don't always know the way

I may not even be the dream you wanted to Come true

But I'll always be the man in love with you
I'm not the key that opens every door
I don't have the power to give you all you Want and more

But when you're needin' something special You can hold on to
I'll always be the man in love with you

I never could work miracles 
There may be others who can do what I Can't do
But no one else can be as good 
As me at lovin' you

So when the world won't turn 
The way you wish it would
And the dreams you have don't come alive As often as they should

Remember that there's someone there 
Whose heart is always true
I'll always be the man in love with you

Remember that there's someone there 
Whose heart is always true
Someone there to help you make it through
I'll always be the man in love with you
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows 
And the star appear
And there is no one to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
There's no doubt in my mind 
Where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing, 
Wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

There ain't nothin' that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
Make you happy make your dreams come true
To make you feel my love 
Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been

I got over you just long enough
To let my heartache mend
Then today, I started loving you again

What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few millions tears I cry

I should have known the worst was yet to Come
And that crying time for me had just begun

'Cause today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough 
To let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again

Well today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend

Then today I started loving you again
Then today I started loving you again
Baby light a couple candles
Lock the bedroom door
Put on some sweet soul music
Throw a blanket on the floor

Surrender to my patient hands
All week I've been your husband
Tonight I wanna be your man

It hit me just this morning
When I passed you in the hall
I swear I caught you looking
Like you don't know me at all

Let me show you who I am
All week I've been your husband
Tonight I wanna be your man

I'll always be your cover when your cold
When the world lines up against you
I'm the safe place you can go
Now and then we need to find some time to Be in love
Just be in love

Now the whole world's in bed sleeping
I think we're finally alone
If the telephone starts ringing
We'll pretend like we're not home

'Cause any fool would understand
All week I've been your husband
Tonight I wanna be your man

Let me show you who I am
All week I've been your husband
Tonight I wanna your man

Just forget about that wedding band
All week I've been your husband
Tonight I wanna be your man

Just the other night 
At a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school Flame
And as I introduced them the past came Back to me

And I couldn't help but think 
Of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God Would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished Back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered Prayers
Remember when your talkin' to the man Upstairs
That just because he may not answer Doesn't mean he don't care

Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered Prayers.

She wasn't quite the angel 
That I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
In her eyes to it seemed

We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after All.

And as she walked away 
And I looked at my wife
And then and there I thanked the good Lord
For the gifts in my life.

Some of God's greatest gifts 
Are all too often unanswered
Some of God's greatest gifts 
Are unanswered prayers.


The bar was empty
I was sweeping up the floor
That's when she walked in

I said,
 I'm sorry but we're closed

And she said,
 I know, but I'm afraid I left my purse

I said, 
I put one back behind the bar
I bet it's probably yours

And the next thing that I knew
There we were, lost in conversation
And before I handed her her purse
I said, 
You'll only get this back on one condition

And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up 
And the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced

And from that moment
There was never any doubt
I had found the one
That I had always dreamed about

And then one evenin'
When she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of My shirt

And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said, 
This is the last thing I expected

And then she took me by the hand
And said, 
I'll only marry you on one condition

And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up 
And the lights turned way down low

The music played, we held each other close
And we danced

Like no one else had ever danced before
I can't explain what happened on that floor
But the music played
We held each other close
And we danced
Yeah, we danced

Day one, I stumbled through hello on 5th Ave
Day two, we grabbed a bite to eat
And talked all afternoon

Caught a movie on day fourteen
And day sixty-seven she said "I love you"
To me

Oh, what a feelin'
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowin'

Ooh, we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave
But chose to stay
What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

Day one-sixteen I asked her what she was Doin' for the rest of my life
Day one eighty- nine, oh I almost lost that girl
To my foolish pride

She said "I do"
On day four eighty-two
And gave me a son
On day seven sixty-one

Oh, what a feelin'
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowin'

Ooh, we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave
But chose to stay
What a beautiful day

Day eighteen thousand two hundred and fifty-three
Well, honey that's fifty years
Yeah, here's to you and me

Oh, what a feelin'
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowin'

Ooh, we had our ups and downs all along the way
She had a chance to leave
But chose to stay
What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

Day one
I thank God I said hello on 5th Ave
These times are troubled 
And these times are good
And they're always gonna be, 
They rise and they fall

We take 'em all the way that we should
Together you and me forsaking them all
Deep in the night and by the light of day
It always looks the same, 
True love always does

And here by your side, 
Or a million miles away
Nothing's ever gonna change 
The way that I feel,
The way it is, is the way that it was

When I said I do, I meant that I will 
'Til the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind when I said I do

Well this old world keeps changin', 
And the world stays the same
For all who came before, 
And it goes hand and hand

Only you and I can undo all that we became
That makes us so much more, 
Than a woman and a man
And after everything that comes and goes Around

Has only passed us by, 
Here alone in our dreams
I know there's a lonely heart 
In every lost and found
But forever you and I will be the ones
Who found out what forever means

When I said I do, 
I meant that I will 'til the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind when I said I do

Truer than true, 
You know that I'll always be there for you
That's what I had in mind, 
That's what I had in mind,
When I said I do
When it's just you, you can't see through
Those ol' clouds that rain so blue

But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through

When somebody loves you
The way I love you

When it's late, the sun hangs low
By yourself, nowhere to go
Sing a song, you dance alone
Play solitaire and stare at the phone

But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through

When somebody loves you
The way I love you

So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
At bein' on our own

'Cause when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through

When somebody loves you
The way I love you

The way I love you
The way I love you
It's amazing
How you can speak
Right to my heart

Without saying a word,
You can light up the dark
Try as I may
I could never explain
What I hear when
You don't say a thing

The smile on your face
Lets me know
That you need me

There's a truth
In your eyes
Saying you'll never leave me

The touch of your hand says
You'll catch me
If ever I fall

You say it best
When you say
Nothing at all

All day long
I can hear people
Talking out loud

But when you hold me near
You drown out the crowd

Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart
And Mine

The smile on your face
Lets me know
That you need me

There's a truth
In your eyes
Saying you'll never leave me

The touch of your hand says
You'll catch me
If ever I fall

You say it best
When you say
Nothing at all

The smile on your face
Lets me know
That you need me

There's a truth
In your eyes
Saying you'll never leave me

The touch of your hand says
You'll catch me 
If ever I fall

Now you say it best
When you say
Nothing at all




One word, that's all you said
Somethin' in your voice caused me to turn my Head.
Your smile, just captured me

And you were in my future 
As far as I could see
And I don't know how it happened, but it happened still
You asked me if I love you, if I always will

Well you had me from "Hello"
I felt love start to grow
The moment that I looked into your eyes, 
You won me

It was over from the start
You completely stole my heart
And now you won't let go
I never even had a chance you know
You had me from "Hello"

Inside, I built a wall
So high around my heart, 
I thought I'd never fall

One touch, you brought it down
The bricks of my defenses 
Scattered on the ground
And I swore to me I wasn't gonna love again
The last time was the last time 
I let someone in

But you had me from "Hello"
I felt love start to grow
The moment that I looked into your eyes, 
You won me

It was over from the start
You completely stole my heart
And now you won't let go
I never even had a chance you know
You had me from "Hello"

That's all you said
Somethin' in your voice caused me to turn my head
You had me from "Hello"
You had me from "Hello"
Girl I've loved you from "Hello"


I know you seen all your dreams turn to dust
I know your hearts been left in the rain to rust
You wont be lonely now

I see the long trail of tears in your eyes
Back to the day when the innocence died
But you wont be lonely now

I wanna give you everything you need
I wanna show you
You wont be lonely,
You wont be lonely now

Holding you here like a rose in the dark
I make this promise to you from my heart
You wont be lonely now

I wanna show you
You wont be lonely now

I'll do anything to make you see
How I'm gonna love you
You wont be lonely, You wont be lonely

Now that your here in my arms I'm alive
For the first time in a long time I
Look at my face in the mirror and see
The man I've wanted to be
Oh yea

I wanna give you everything you need
I wanna show you
You wont be lonely now

I'll do anything to make you see
How I'm gonna love you
You wont be lonely, You wont be lonely
You wont be lonely now
Life may not always go your way
And every once in awhile 
You might have a bad day
But I promise you now
You won't ever be lonely

The sky turns dark 
And everything goes wrong
Run to me and I'll leave the light on
And I promise you now 
You won't ever be lonely

For as long as I live
There will always be a place you belong
Here beside me
Heart and soul baby, you only
And I promise you now 
You won't ever be lonely

It's still gonna snow and it's still gonna rain
The wind's gonna blow on a cold winter day
And I promise you now 
You won't ever be lonely

You're safe from the world
Wrapped in my arms
And I'll never let go
Baby, here's where it starts
And I promise you now 
You won't ever be lonely

Here's a shoulder you can cry on
And a love you can rely on
For as long as I live
There will always be a place you belong

Here beside me
Heart and soul baby, you only
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
No, no, you won't ever be lonely
The first time I looked
In your eyes I knew
That I would do anything for you

The first time you touched
My face I felt
What I'd never felt with anyone else

I want to give back what
You've given to me
And I want to witness all of your dreams

Now that you've shown me
Who I really am
I wanna be more than just your man

I wanna be the wind that fills your sail
Be the hand that lifts your veil
Be the moon that moves your tides

The sun coming up in your eyes
Be the wheel that never rusts
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of
And more, so much more
I wanna be your everything

When you wake up
I'll be the first thing you see
And when it gets dark
You can reach out to me

I'll cherish your words
I'll finish your thoughts
I'll be your compass, baby
When you get lost

I wanna be the wind that fills your sail
Be the hand that lifts your veil
Be the moon that moves your tides

The sun coming up in your eyes
Be the wheel that never rusts
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of
And more...so much more
I wanna be your everything

I'll be the wheel that never rusts
Be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of
And more, so much more

I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your everything

Baby lock the door 
And turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

There's no hurry
Don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer
Lets go over
What I had in mind

Baby lock the door 
And turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

Ain't nobody ever love nobody
The way that I love you
We're alone now
You don't know how
Long I've wanted to

Lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
never felt a feeling that was quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

I Can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man



I've had my share
Of life's ups and downs
But fates been kind
The downs have been few

I guess you could say
I've been lucky
Or I guess you could say
That it's all because of you

If anyone, should ever write, my life story
For whatever reason there might be,
You'd be there,
Between each line of pain and glory,

'Cause your the best thing,
That ever happened to me,
Oh you're the best thing,
That ever happened to me.

There have been times,
When times were hard,
But always somehow I made it, 
I made it through,

But for every moment that I've been hurtin',
There's been a moment, that I've spent
Oh just loving you,

If anyone should ever write my life story,
For whatever,
For whatever reason there might be,
You'd be there, 
Between each line of pain and glory,

'Cause you're the best thing,
That ever happened to me,
Oh your the best thing,
That ever happened to me,

Don't you know, you're the best thing
Oh that ever happened,
To me.

Everytime that I'm lookin' at you

You're the most beautiful girl I know
And I got no place to go

Spendin' all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
Need a few more seconds in my day
Spendin' all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you

Every minutes runnin' away
From when I wake up

If they take you away from me

Make you better when
All your hopes start runnin' away

Baby this is your song
No it's not the slow song
Say anything just to make you smile
Baby won't you stay awhile?

Spendin' all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you

Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly

Just a little change
Small, to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise

Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast

Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe

Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze upon me

Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul

How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Now the night has gone
Now the night has gone away
Doesn't seem that long
We hardly had two words to say

Hold me in your arms for just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh, we have the right you know
We have the right you know

Don't say the morning's come
Don't say the morning's come, so soon
Must we end this way
When so much here is hard to lose

Love is everywhere I know it is
Such moments as this are too few
Oh, it's all up to you
It's all up to you

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Tell me we can stay
Tell me we can stay, oh please
Those are the words to say
The only words I can believe

Hold me in your arms for just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh, we have the right you know
We have the right you know

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

The night has gone, a part of yesterday
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

When I think back
On these times
And the dreams
We left behind

I'll be glad 'cause
I was blessed to get
To have you in my life

When I look back
On these days
I'll look and see your face
You were right there for me

In my dreams
I'll always see you soar
Above the sky

In my heart
There will always be a place
For you for all my life

I'll keep a part
Of you with me
And everywhere I am
There you'll be

And everywhere I am
There you'll be

Well you showed me
How it feels
To feel the sky
Within my reach

And I always
Will remember all
The strength you
Gave to me

Your love made me
Make it through
Oh, I owe so much to you
You were right there for me

In my dreams
I'll always see you soar
Above the sky

In my heart
There will always be a place
For you for all my life

I'll keep a part
Of you with me
And everywhere I am
There you'll be

And everywhere I am
There you'll be

'Cause I always saw in you
My light, my strength
And I want to thank you
Now for all the ways

You were right there for me
You were right there for me
For always

In my dreams
I'll always see you soar
Above the sky

In my heart
There will always be a place
For you for all my life

I'll keep a part
Of you with me
And everywhere I am
There you'll be

And everywhere I am
There you'll be
There you'll be 
We've only just begun to live,
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way.
And yes, We've just begun.

Before the rising sun we fly,
So many roads to choose
We start our walking and learn to run.
And yes, We've just begun.

Sharing horizons that are new to us,
Watching the signs along the way,
Talking it over just the two of us,
Working together day to day
Together.

And when the evening comes we smile,
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow,
And yes, We've just begun.



I never needed love like I need you
And I never lived for nobody, but I live for you
ooh, babe, lost in love is what I feel when I'm with you

Maybe it's the way you touch me
With the warmth of a sun
Maybe it's the way you smile, 
I come all undone

ooh, babe, lost in love is that I feel when I'm with you

Baby, oh I get chills when I'm with you
Baby, my world stands still when I'm with you
When I'm with you

I never cared for nobody like I care for you
And I never wanted to share the things 
I want to share with you

ooh, babe, lost in love is what I feel 
When I'm with you

Baby, oh I get chills when I'm with you
Baby, my world stands still when I'm with you
When I'm with you

Baby, oh I get chills when I'm with you
Baby, my world stands still when I'm with you

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
Look at this face,
I know the years are showing,
Look at this life,
I still don't know where it's going.

I don't know much,
But I know I love you,
And that may be all I need to know.

Look at these eyes,
They've never see what matter,
Look at these dreams,
So beaten and so battered.

I don't know much,
But I know I love you,
And that may be all I need to know.

So many questions still left unanswered,
So much I've never broken through,
And when I feel you near me,
Sometimes I see so clearly,
The only truth I've ever known,
Is me and you.

Look at this man,
So blessed with inspiration,
Look at this soul,
Still searching for salvation.

I don't know much,
But I know I love you,
And that may be all I need to know.

I don't know much,
But I know I love you,
And that may be all I need to know.

I don't know much,
But I know I love you,
And that may be all I need to know.

I don't know much,
But I know I love you,
And that may be all I need to know.




Sitting here just staring at your picture
Waiting for your call
So unclear, I'm hanging on a notion
We could have it all

Time and time again you tell me to be patient
But we cant let love slip away

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, Oh oh, oh, darlin' 
A love like this is hard to find
Don't make me wait for love

Hmm, I close the blinds 
And try to hide the darkness

Fall asleep alone
Give me a sign, 
A man ain't supposed to face life
Standing on his own

When you're near me 
I can't help but see forever
Come and rescue me tonight

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, Oh oh, oh, darlin' 
A love like this is hard to find
Cant you see I need your love, I need you

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, Yeah

Oh, oh, darlin' 
A love like this is hard to find
Don't make me wait for love

Oh, oh, oh, baby, don't make me 
Wait for love this time, oh

Oh, oh, darlin' 
A love like this is hard to find
Can't you see I need your love, I need you

Baby, dont make me wait for love this time
Oh, oh, darlin'
A love like this is hard to find, ooh, baby

Baby, don't make me wait for love this time, 
I need you, baby
I love you, I need you, I want you, baby

Everybody’s looking for love. Oh. Oh.
Ain’t that the reason you’re at this club. 
Oh. Oh.

You ain’t gonna find it dancing with him. 
No. Oh.
I got a better solution for you girl. Oh. Oh.

Just leave with me now. 
Say the word and we’ll go.
I’ll be your teacher. 
I’ll show you the ropes.
You’ll see a side of love you’ve never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
You’ll be screaming out.

In my head, it’s going down.
In my head, it’s going down.
In my head. Yeah. 
In my head. Oh yeah.

Some dudes know all the right things to say.
When it comes down to it, it’s all just game.
Instead of talking let me demonstrate. Yeah.
Get down to business and skip foreplay.

Just leave with me now.
Say the word and we’ll go.
I’ll be your teacher
I’ll show you the ropes.
You’ll see a side of love you’ve never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
You’ll be screaming out.

In my head, it’s going down.
In my head, it’s going down.
In my head.

Break it down. Ay-oh. Come on. Ay-oh. Ay-oh.
You singing to me baby in my head right now. Ay-oh. Ay-oh. Come on.
She’ll be screaming out when it all goes down.

Just leave with me now, 
Say the word and we’ll go. 
We can go.

I’ll be your teacher. I’ll show you the ropes.
You’ll see a side of love you’ve never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
You’ll be screaming out.
In my head, it’s going down.
In my head, it’s going down.

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
You’ll be screaming out.

In my head, it’s going down.
In my head, it’s going down.
In my head.

I never had no one
I could count on
I've been let down so many times

I was tired of hurtin'
So tired of searchin'
'Til you walked into my life

It was a feelin'
I'd never known
And for the first time
I didn't feel alone

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do

Oh we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense

You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

You stand by me
And you believe in me
Like nobody ever has

When my world goes crazy
You're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have

And I still tremble
When we touch
And oh the look in your eyes
When we make love

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do

Oh we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

And I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense

You're my best friend
You're my best friend

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do

Oh we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

And I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense

You're my best friend
You're my best friend (my best friend)
You're my best friend (my best friend)
I believe the children 
Are our are future
Teach them well 
And let them lead the way

Show them all the beauty 
They possess inside
Give them a sense of pride 
To make it easier

Let the children's laughter 
Remind us how we used to be
Everybody searching for a hero

People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone to fulfill my needs
A lonely place to be
So I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago, 
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I live as I believe

No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me

I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve

Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well 
And let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty
They possess inside

Give them a sense of pride 
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter 
Remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago, 
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I live as I believe

No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me

I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me

The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

And if by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love


My first kiss went a little like this
And twist
And twist

Well my first kiss went a little like this
And twist
And twist

I said no more teachers
And no more books
I got a kiss under the bleachers
Hoping that nobody looks

Lips like liquorish
Tongue like candy
Excuse me miss
But can I get you out your panties?

In the back of the car
On the way to the bar
I got you on my list
(I got you on my list)

At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

She won’t ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way,
You know that I’d make her say

Oooooh
Oooooh

She won’t ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way,
You know that I’d make her say

Oooooh
Oooooh

Well my first kiss went a little like this
I said no more sailors
And no more soldiers

With your name in a heart
Tattooed up on the shoulders
Your kiss is like whiskey
It gets me drunk

And I wake up in the morning 
With the taste of your tongue

In the back of the car
On the way to the bar
I got you on my list
(I got you on my list)

At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

She won’t ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way,
You know that I’d make her say

Oooooh
Oooooh

She won’t ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way,
You know that I’d make her say

Oooooh
Oooooh

My first went a little like this
And twist
And twist

Well My first kiss went a little like this
And twist
And twist

She won’t ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I’d make her say

Ooooooh
Ooooooh

She won’t ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way,
You know that I’d make her say

Oooooooh
Oooooooh

She won’t ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way,
You know that I’d make her say
If a picture paints a thousand words,
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show 
The you I've come to know.

If a face could launch a thousand ships,
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you,
You're all that's left me too.

And when my love for life is running dry,
You come and pour yourself on me.

If a man could be two places at one time,
I'd be with you.
Tomorrow and today,
 beside you all the way.

If the world should stop 
Revolving spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you.

And when the world was through,
Then one by one the stars would all go out,
Then you and I would simply fly away 
Maybe I need some rehab, 
Or maybe just need some sleep
I've got a sick obsession, 
I'm seeing it in my dreams

I'm looking down every alley, 
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping, 
Hittin' my head against the walls

What you've got boy is hard to find
I think about it all about it all the time
I'm all strung up my heart is fried
I just cant get you off my mind

Because your love, 
Your love, 
Your love, 
Is my drug

Your love, 
Your love, 
Your love

I said your love, 
Your love, 
Your love, 
Is my drug
Your love your love your love

Won't listen to any advice, 
Mamma's telling I should think twice
But left to my own devices 
I'm addicted its a crisis

My friends think I've gone crazy, 
My judgment is getting kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected 
If I keep it up like a love sick crackhead

What you've got boy is hard to find 
I think about it all about it all the time
I'm all strung up my heart is fried
I just cant get you off my mind

Because your love, 
Your love, 
Your love, 
Is my drug

Your love, 
Your love,
Your love

I said your love, 
Your love, 
Your love, 
Is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you are away

So I got a question;
Do you want to have a summer party 
in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like a native drum?
Is my love, your drug?

(huh)
Your drug? (huh)
Your drug? (huh) 
Your drug?
Is my love, your drug?

Because your love, 
Your love, 
Your love, 
Is my drug

Your love,
Your love, 
Your love

I said your love, 
Your love, 
Your love, 
Is my drug

Your love, your love, your love 
Your love, your love, your love 
Your love, your love, your love 
When I was younger
I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind

He broke his own heart
And I watched
As he tried to reassemble it

And my momma swore that
She would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised

I'd never sing of love
If it does not exist

But darling,
You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception

Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul
That love never lasts

And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone
Keep a straight face

And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable, distance
And up until now

I had sworn to myself that I'm
Content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Well, You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't let go 
Of what's in front of me here

I know you're leaving
In the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof 
It's not a dream

You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception
You, are, the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, And I'm on my way to believing
Everybody in love, go put your hands up
Everybody in love, go put your hands up
Everybody in love, go put your hands up
If you’re in love, put your hands up hand up

You know you need someone
When the need’s so strong
When they’re gone 

You don’t know how to go on
So the whole world is stuck in a moment
Standing still until they come back

You accept that they’ve, 
Got things to do
But sometimes in the end 
There’s nothing left for you

If hurt is missing your baby
I’ve done too much of it lately

'Cause every minute's like an hour
Every hours like a day
Every day lasts forever

But what else am I gonna do
I’d wait forever and a day for you
I wait up, wait up

I can’t eat, I can’t sleep
what else could it be missing so deep
Long as I’m where you’re going to

I’d wait forever and a day for you
I wait up, wait up for you

And even when we mad, 
And say we’re through
Deep inside you 
Feel the same way I do

Might as well turn around and just end this
'Cause it’s harder tryin' to stay mad
I could tell you that you can’t stay here
Knowing just as soon as you disappear

That I’ll be missing you baby
Soon as you get up and you walk away

Every minutes like an hour
Every hours like a day
Every day lasts forever
But what else am I gonna do

I’d wait forever and a day for you
I wait up, wait up

I can’t eat, I can’t sleep
what else could it be missing you so deep
Long as I’m where you’re going to

I’d wait forever and a day for you
I wait up, wait up for you

Everybody in love
Go put your hands up
Everybody in love
Go put your hands up

Everybody in love
Go put your hands up
If you’re in love
Put your hands up

Everybody in love
Go put your hands up
Everybody in love
Go put your hands up

Everybody in love
Go put your hands up
If your in love
Put your hands up

Every minutes like an hour
Every hours like a day
Every day lasts forever
But what else am I gonna do

I’d wait forever and a day for you
I wait up, wait up

I can’t eat, I can’t sleep
what else could it be missing you so deep
Long as I’m where you’re going to

I’d wait forever and a day for you
I wait up, wait up for you
Winter snow is falling down
Children laughing all around
Lights are turning on
Like a fairy tale come true

Sitting by the fire we made
You're the answer when I prayed
I would find someone
And baby I found you

All I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more every day
You saved my heart
From being broken apart

You gave your love away
And I'm thankful every day
For the gift

Watching as you softly sleep
What I'd give if I could keep
Just this moment
If only time stood still

But the colors fade away
And the years will make us gray
But baby in my eyes
You'll still be beautiful

All I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more every day
You saved my heart
From being broken apart

You gave your love away
And I'm thankful every day
For the gift

All I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more every day
You saved my heart
From being broken apart

You gave your love away
I can't find the words to say
That I'm thankful every day
For the gift 
Since you've been away
I've been down and lonely
Since you've been away
I've been thinking of you

Trying to understand
The reason you left me
What were you going through

I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns

As I look around
I see things that remind me
Just to see you smile
Made my heart fill with joy

I'll still recall
All those dreams we shared together
Where did you run to, boy

I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns

Sometimes I've wondered
I didn't understand
Just where you were trying to go

Only you knew the plan
And I tried to be there
But you wouldn't let me in

But now you've gone away boy
I feel so broken hearted
I knew the day we started
That we were meant to be
If only you'd let me

I've cried so many tears
Gotta face now all my fears
We let time slip away
I need you boy
Here today

There was so much you gave me
To my heart
To my soul

There was so much of your dreams
That were never told
You had so much hope

For a brighter day
Why were you my flower
Plucked away

I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh oohooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns


Picture perfect memories 
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 
'Cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, 
I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but 
I lost all control and I need you now

And I don't know how 
I can do without
I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey 
Can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping 
In the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, 
I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but 
I lost all control and I need you now

And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

woah woah.

Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at al
l
It's a quarter after one 
I'm all alone and I need you now

And I said I wouldn't call but 
I'm a little drunk and I need you now

And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
I just need you now

Ooh, baby, I need you now

We are the crowd, we're comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you
It so magical, we'd be so fantastical

Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing light
'Cause you know that baby, I

I'm your biggest fan,
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa, paparazzi

Baby, there's no other superstar, 
You know that I'll be
Your papa, paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, 
Chase you down until you love me
Papa, paparazzi

I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, cause you're my rock star 
In between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes

Shadow is burnt, yellow dance and we turn
My lashes are dry, purple teardrops I cry
It don't have a price, loving you is cherry pie
Cause you know that baby, I

I'm your biggest fan, 
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa, paparazzi

Baby, there's no other superstar, 
You know that I'll be
Your papa, paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, 
Chase you down until you love me
Papa, paparazzi

Real good, we dance in the studio
Snap, snap to that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic but we still have fun

I'm your biggest fan, 
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa, paparazzi

Baby, there's no other superstar, 
You know that I'll be
Your papa, paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, 
Chase you down until you love me
Papa, paparazzi

People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one,
And we've only just begun.
Think I'm gonna have a son.

He will be like she and me, as free as a dove,
Conceived in love.
Sun is gonna shine above.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.

And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Seems as though, a month ago, I was Beta-Chi,
Never got high.
Oh, I was a sorry guy.

And now, I smile and face 
The girl that shares my name.
Now I'm through with the game.
This boy will never be the same.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.

And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Pisces, Virgo rising is a very good sign,
Strong and kind,
And the little boy is mine.

Now I see a family where the once was none.
Now we've just begun.
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.

And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Love the girl who holds 
The world in a paper cup.
Drink it up.
Love her and she'll bring you luck.

And if you find she helps your mind, 
Better take her home.
Don't you live alone.
Try to earn what lovers own.

And even though we ain't got money,
I'm so in love with you, honey,
And everything will bring a chain of love.

And in the morning, when I rise,
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Don't go changing, to try and please me
You never let me down before
Don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore
I wouldn't leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are.

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you.

I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from the heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are.

How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own and I can tell
It comes naturally, it comes naturally

You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive, you don't have to try
It comes naturally, mm it comes naturally

And it takes my breath away
What you do, so naturally

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting

When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally,
It comes naturally
When you're with me, baby

Everything comes naturally, 
It comes naturally
Bay bay baby

You have a way of moving me
A force of nature, your energy
It comes naturally 
(You know it does)
It comes naturally
Mm yeah

And it takes my breath away (Every time)
What you do, so naturally

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting

When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby

Everything comes naturally, 
It comes naturally
Bay bay baby

When we collide, sparks fly
When you look in my eyes, 
It takes my breath away

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting

When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby

Everything comes naturally,

And I'ma let this ride

Sparks fly
Its like electricity
I might die

When I forget how to breath
You get closer and there’s
No where in this world I’d rather be

Time stops
Like everything around me
Its frozen

And nothing matters but these
Few moments when you 
Open my mind to things
I’ve never seen

'Cause when I’m kissing you
My senses come alive

Almost like the puzzle piece
I’ve been trying to find
Falls right into place

You’re all that it takes
My doubts fade away
When I’m kissing you

When I’m kissing you
It all starts making sense

And all the questions
I’ve been asking in my head
Like are you the one should I really trust

Crystal clear it becomes
When I’m kissing you

Past loves
They never got very far
Walls of made sure

I’ve got in my heart
And I promise I wouldn’t do this till
I knew it was right for me

But no one (no one)
No guy that I met before
Could make me (make me)
Feel so right and secure

And have you noticed
I lose my focus
And the world around me disappears

Cause when I’m kissing you
My senses come alive

Almost like the puzzle piece
I’ve been trying to find
Falls right into place

You’re all that it takes
My doubts fade away
When I’m kissing you

When I’m kissing you
It all starts making sense

And all the questions
I’ve been asking in my head
Like are you the one should I really trust

Crystal clear it becomes
When I’m kissing you

I’ve never felt nothing like this
You’re making me open up
No point in even trying to fight this
It kinda feels like it’s love

Cause when I’m kissing you
My senses come alive

Almost like the puzzle piece
I’ve been trying to find
Falls right into place

You’re all that it takes
My doubts fade away
When I’m kissing you

When I’m kissing you
It all starts making sense

And all the questions
I’ve been asking in my head
Like are you the one should I really trust

How clear it becomes
When I’m kissing you

But in my heart I feel the same old afterglow
A love so beautiful in every way
A love so beautiful we let it slip away

We were all too young 
To understand to ever know
That lovers drift apart and 
That's the way love goes

A love so beautiful a love so free
A love so beautiful a love for you and me

And when I think of you I fall in love again
A love so beautiful in every way
A love so beautiful we let it slip away

And when I think of you I fall in love again
A love so beautiful we let it slip away
A love so beautiful in every way

Penny lover, don't you make me cry
Can't you see girl, who my heart's beating for
You're the only girl that I adore

The first time I saw you
Oh, you looked so fine
And I had a feeling
One day you'd be mine

Honey you came along 
And captured my heart

Now there's one more thing I'd like to say

Don't you ever take your sweet love away
Girl I'll do anything, just please stay

But I'm not gonna worry, no not anymore
'Cause when a man's in love, 
He's only got one story

Lost in your kiss

With a love like yours, it's hard to resist

You had the look in your eye, 

Yeah, Yeah
Ooh pretty baby

I just wanted to reach out 
And touch you baby
I just want to reach out and hold ya, 

I want to reach out and say 
Ooh, Ooh

Don't make me cry
I wanna talk about you everyday 
(Penny lover)
Need you, need you baby 


Oh baby
Say, now, you
You talk about the things I do
But baby, I yeah,
I'll try and explain the reasons why

'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout the things
That we said late last night,
When every word I said
Just didn't come out right,

And you were so afraid
That I'd found someone new
But darlin', well, there's no need
For what we're goin' through

Because you and I've been in love too long
To worry 'bout tomorrow
Here's a place where we both belong

I know you're the only woman 
That I'm dreamin' of
You're the only woman that I really love

Baby, see what a foolish heart
Has done for me
Darlin', why yeah would you break 
My heart and make me cry?

Well now, you can't go back 
And change the way things are,
And all this foolish talk won't take us very far

And so I hope you're list'nin' 
'Cause I'm tellin' you
About the, the way I feel 
And what I'm goin' through

Because you and I've been in love too long
To worry 'bout tomorrow
Here's a place where we both belong

I know you're the only 
Woman that I'm dreamin' of
You're the only woman that I really love

Oh Don't speak Sshh

When the pain of love surrounds you
And the world may be unkind
I'll put my lovin' arms around you
Take you far from this place and time

Because you and I've been in love too long
To worry 'bout tomorrow
Here's a place where we both belong

I know you're the only 
Woman that I'm dreamin' of
You're the only woman that I really love

You're the only woman 
You're the only woman

I know you're the only woman
 You're the only woman
Well now you're the only woman
You're the only woman

I didn't know what day it was
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon

Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical

I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsly prints
I put down to experience

The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
You're beauty and elegance

You're a rhapsody, a comedy
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
But honey what do you see in me

You're an essay in glamor
Please pardon the grammar
But you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic, United, but babyI've decided
You're the best team I've ever seen

And there have been many affairs
Many times I've thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around

'Cause you're the warmest thing 
I've ever found
I'm, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me

'Cause you make me feel, so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Me sayin' since, baby, 
Since we've been together
Ooh, loving you forever
Is what I need

Let me, be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue
Ooh baby

Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why somebody, why people break up
Oh, and turn around and make up
I just can't see

You'd never do that to me
(Would you baby)
'Cause being around you is all I see
It's why I want us to

Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Am I really here in your arms
Its just like I dreamed it would be
I feel like we're frozen in time
And you're the only one I can see


Hey, I've looked All my Life for you
And now you're here
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you
All my Life

And I never really knew how to love
I just hoped somehow I'd see
Asked for a little help from above
Send that angel down to me


Hey, I've looked All my Life for you
And now you're here
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you
All my Life

I never thought that I could feel a love so tender
I never thought I could let those feelings show
But now my heart is on my sleeve
and this love will never leave
I know
I know

Hey, I've looked All my Life for you
And now you're here
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you
All my Life
All my Life

Hey, I've looked All my Life for you
And now you're here
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you
All my Life
Oh, oh, oh, I am
I had it all
But I let it slip away

Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go

I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time

I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there
Alone

Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete

Lord I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go

I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there alone

You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me

You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do
Inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so
Satisfied

I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high

It feel like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

In the morning
When I rise
You are the first thing
On my mind

And in the middle
Of the night
I feel your heartbeat
Next to mine

It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if its real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You know the way 
To make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so
High

You've got me feeling higher



I can hear her heart beat 
For a thousand miles
And the heavens open 
Every time she smiles

And when I come to her, 
That's where I belong
I'm running to her like a river's song

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor 
When I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her 
When the sun goes down

Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache 
In the night like a thief

Give me love, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, Gimme crazy love
Give me love, love, love, yes sir, crazy love

Yes, I need her in the daytime
Yes, I need her in the night
But I want to throw my arms around her

Kiss her an' hug her, kiss her an' hug her tight
Kiss her an' hug her tight, through the night

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' 
Brighten up my day

It'll make me feel righteous, 
Make me feel whole
Make me feel mellow down into my soul

Give me love, gimme love, yes sir, crazy love
Give me love, gimme, gimme, 
Gimme, crazy love

I said she give me love, love, love, aw, 
Crazy love
She give me, yeah, crazy love

I said give me love, love, love, love, 
Crazy love
She give me love, love, yes sir, 
A crazy love, one more time

She give me love, love, love, love, 
She give me crazy love
She give me love, love, love, 
Yes sir crazy love

Roses by the dozen, talking on the phone

Compliment what she does
Send her roses just because
If it's violins she loves
Let them play

Dedicate her favourite song
And hold her closer all night long
Love her today
Find one hundred ways

Don't forget, there could be
An old lover in her memory
If you need her so much more
Why don't you say?

Maybe she has it in her mind
That she's just wasting her time
Ask her to stay
Find one hundred ways

Being cool won't help you keep a love warm
You'll just blow your only chance
Take the time to open up your heart
That's the secret of romance

Sacrifice if you care
Buy her some moonlight to wear
If it's one more star she wants
Go all the way

In your arms tonight, she'll reflect
That she owes you the sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay
Find one hundred ways

Love her today
Find one hundred ways
Who can say for certain
Maybe you're still here
I feel you all around me
Your memory, so clear

Deep in the stillness
I can hear you speak
You're still an inspiration
Can it be 

That you are mine
Forever love
And you are watching over me from up above

Fly me up to where you are
Beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight

To see you smile
If only for awhile to know you're there
A breath away not far
To where you are

Are you gently sleeping
Here inside my dream
And isn't faith believing
All power can't be seen

As my heart holds you
Just one beat away
I cherish all you gave me everyday

'Cause you are my
Forever love
Watching me from up above

And I believe
That angels breathe
And that love will live on and never leave

Fly me up
To where you are
Beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight

To see you smile
If only for awhile
To know you're there
A breath away not far
To where you are

I know you're there
A breath away not far
To where you are


When I first saw you standing there
You know it was a little hard not to stare
So nervous when I drove you home
I know being apart is a little hard to bare.

Send some flowers to your work in hopes
That I'd have you in my arms again
We kissed that night before I left

Still now that's something
I could never forget
You've got all that I need

Looking at all or nothing
Babe it`s you and I

With you I know that
I am good for something
So lets go give it a try

We got our backs against the ocean
It`s just us against the world

Looking at all or nothing
Babe it`s you and I
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it`s you and I

Lets take a chance go far away today
And never look back again
Since i said I loved you in Las Vegas
It`s never been the same since then
You've got all that i need

Looking at all or nothing
Babe it`s you and I

With you I know
I am good for something
So lets go give it a try

We got our backs against the ocean
It`s just us against the world

Looking at all or nothing
Babe it`s you and I
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it`s you and I

This is it nothing to hide
One more kiss never say goodbye
This is it baby your all mine

Looking at all or nothing
Babe it`s you and I
I know that I am good for something
So lets go give it a try

We got our backs against the ocean
It`s just us against the world

Looking at all or nothing
Babe it`s you and I
With you I know that
I am good for something
So lets go give it a try

We got our backs against the ocean
It`s just us against the world

Looking at all or nothing
Babe it`s you and I
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it`s you and I
Babe it`s you and I
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you 
So I should've held on tight, 
I never should've let you go

I didn't know nothing, 
I was stupid, 
I was foolish
I was lying to myself 

I could not fathom 
I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be 
Sitting here beside myself

'Cause I didn't know you, 
'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt 

The feeling that I'm feeling 
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 
'Cause I don't have a choice

Oh, what I wouldn't give 
To have you lying by my side
Right here, 
'Cause baby
(We belong together) 

When you left I lost a part of me 
(Together)

It's still so hard to believe
(Come back, come back)
Come back baby, please
(Come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together 

Who else am I gon' lean on 
When times get rough 
(Oooh yeah)

Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up 
(Oooooh yeah)

Who's gonna take your place,
There ain't nobody better 
(Oooh yeah)
Oh, baby baby, we belong together 

I can't sleep at night 
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio saying to me:
"If you think you're lonely now"

Wait a minute this is too deep 
(Too deep)
I gotta change the station so I turn the dial
And then I hear Babyface

I only think of you and it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together 
But I'm falling apart 

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out 
Where the hell I went wrong

The pain inflicted in this song 
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby
(We belong together)

When you left I lost a part of me 
(Together)

It's still so hard to believe
(Come back, come back)
Come back baby, please
(Come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together 

Who else am I gon' lean on 
When times get rough 
(Oooh yeah)

Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up 
(Oooh yeah)

Who's gonna take your place,
There ain't nobody better 
(Oooh yeah)

Oh, baby baby, we belong together baby
(We belong together)

When you left I lost a part of me 
(Together)
(Oooh yeah)

It's still so hard to believe
(Come back, come back)
Come back baby, please
(Ooooh yeah)

(Come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together 

Who else am I gon' lean on 
When times get rough 
(Oooh yeah)

Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up (Oooh yeah)

Who's gonna take your place,
There ain't nobody better 
(Oooh yeah)

Oh, baby baby, we belong together

Oooh yeah
Oooh yeah
Oooh yeah
We belong together
Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday

They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong

(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life

(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night

Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'

They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong

(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life

(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
You're still the one

(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life

(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night

I'm so glad we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
Can't you see?
There's a feeling that's come over me
Close my eyes
You're the only one that leaves me completely breathless

No need to wonder why
Sometimes a gift like this you can't deny

Cause I wanted to fly,
so you gave me your wings
And time held its breath so I could see, yeah
And you set me free

There's a will
There's a way
Sometimes words just can't explain
This is real
I'm afraid
I guess this time there's just no hiding, fighting
You make me restless

You're in my heart
The only light that shines
there in the dark

Cause I wanted to fly,
so you gave me your wings
And time held its breath so I could see, yeah
And you set me free

When I was alone
You came around
When I was down
You pulled me through
And there's nothing that
I wouldn't do for you

Cause I wanted to fly,
so you gave me your wings
And time held its breath so I could see, yeah
And you set me free 
While everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
And there's a thousand ways you can skin it

My feet have been on the floor
Flat like an idle singer
Remember winger
I digress
I confess you are the best thing in my life

But I'm afraid when I hear stories
About a husband and wife
There's no happy endings
No Henry Lee
But you are the greatest thing about me

If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whenever
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, Love
That's enough for me

Took a loan on a house I own
Can't be a queen bee without a bee throne
I wanna buy ya everything
Except cologne
'cause it's poison
We can travel to Spain where the rain falls
Mainly on the plain side and sing
'cause it is we can laugh we can sing
Have ten kids and give them everything
Hold our cell phones up in the air
And just be glad we made it here alive
On a spinning ball in the middle of space
I love you from your toes to your face

You can move in
I won't ask where you've been
'cause everybody has a past
When we're older
We'll do it all over again

When everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
I'm in it for you

If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whenever
Then the rest is just whenever

If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me
She got the call today
One out of the gray
And when the smoke cleared
It took her breath away

She said she didn't believe
It could happen to me
I guess we're all one phone call from our knees

We're gonna get there soon

If every building falls
And all the stars fade
We'll still be singing this song
The one they can't take away

I'm gonna get there soon
She's gonna be there too
Cryin' in her room
Prayin' oh, Lord come through

We're gonna get there soon

Oh, it's your light
Oh, it's your way
Pull me out of the dark
Just to shoulder the weight
Cryin' out now
From so far away
You pull me closer to love
Closer to love

Meet me once again
Down off Lake Michigan
Where we could feel the storm blowin'
Down with the wind

And don't apologize
For all the tears you've cried
You've been way too strong now for all your life

I'm gonna get there soon
You're gonna be there too
Cryin' in your room
Prayin' Lord come through

We're gonna get there soon

Oh, it's your light
Oh, it's your way
Pull me out of the dark
Just to shoulder the weight
Cryin' out now
From so far away
You pull me closer to love
Closer to love

Cause you are all that I've waited for all of my life
We're gonna get there
You are all that I've waited all of my life

You pull me closer to love
Closer to love
Pull me closer to love (You are all that I've waited for)
You pull me closer to love
Closer to love
Closer to love (Cause you are all that I've waited for)
Closer to love

Pull me closer to love
I just called to let you know I’m buckled in my seat
On a jet airliner headed back to Tennessee
We’ve been together for years, I’m gone for one day
Girl I miss you like I did after our first date
And this crazy love, it’s strong as it ever was

Baby you still got it and I still want it, oh yeah
Just in case you didn’t know it, you got it goin’ on, oh yeah
I’m all yours, you’re all mine
Girl you turn me on after all this time
Baby you still got it and I still want it

So baby fire up some candles and turn the lights down low
Dial up something sexy on the radio
I got a bottle of wine, I’m almost home
Put one of those silky little nothings on
We can stay up late
We got something to celebrate.

Baby you still got it and I still want it, oh yeah
Just in case you didn’t know it, well you got it goin’ on, oh yeah
I’m all yours, and you’re all mine
Girl you turn me on after all this time
Baby you still got it and I still want it

Girl you got me hangin’ on your every kiss
That’s the way it was, that’s the way it is

Baby you still got it and I still want it, oh yeah
Just in case you didn’t know it, you got it goin’ on, oh yeah
I’m all yours, you’re all mine
Girl you turn me on after all this time
Baby you still got it and I still want it
You still got it
Seems like ever since the first day we met
There is no one else I think of more than you
Can't seem to forget,
can't get you out my head
Guess theverdict's in, I'm crazy over you
How can one be down, tell me where to start
Cause every time you smile,I feel trembles in my heart
I have but one concern, how can I get with you
Til my day comes, here's what I'm gonna do

Be sittin' up in my room
Back here thinkin' bout you
I must confess,I'm a mess for you
Be sittin' up in my room
Back here thinkin' bout you
Im just a mess with a thang for you

Pray that you'll invest in my happiness
All it takes is just one simple call from you
Turn my heart around,
if I'm making ground
Pretty baby please, tell me if I'm getting through
Tell me what is up
You see I need to know
Tell me if I'm far or, if I'm getting close
I have but one concern, and that one concern is you
Til I'm with you,here's what I'm gonna do

Be sittin' up in my room
Back here thinkin' bout you
I must confess,I'm a mess for you
Be sittin' up in my room
Back here thinkin' bout you
Im just a mess with a thang for you

How can one reach out, tell
me where to startCause everytime you smile,
I feel trembles in my heart
I have but one concern,how can I get with you
Til my day comes, here's what I'm gonna do
I have always been a little shy 
I've always been the quiet type till now 
And I never let my feelings show 
I never let anybody know 
Just how much I was so deep in love 
But now that you're in my arms 

I'm gonna stand on a rooftop, climb up a mountaintop 
Baby, scream and shout 
I wanna sing it on the radio, show it on a video 
Baby, leave no doubt 
I want the whole world to know just what I'm all about 
I love to love you out loud 

You keep bringing out the free in me 
What you do to my heart just makes me melt 
And I don't think I can resist 
But I've never been one to kiss and tell 
A love this true can't be subdued 
So I'm gonna let out a yell 

I'm gonna stand on a rooftop, climb up a mountaintop 
Baby, scream and shout 
I wanna sing it on the radio, show it on a video 
Baby, leave no doubt 
I want the whole world to know just what I'm all about 
I love to love you out loud 

Baby, I want the whole world to see 
Just how good your love looks on me 

I'm gonna stand on a rooftop, climb up a mountaintop 
Baby, scream and shout 
I wanna sing it on the radio, show it on a video 
Baby, leave no doubt 
I want the whole world to know just what I'm all about 
I love to love you out loud 

Baby, I love to love you out loud 
Yeah, I love to love you out loud
You can take everything that I own
You can take everything that I’ve ever known
You can clean out the bank
Burn it all up in flames
Take it all and run, I'll be okay
Cause I don't need a thing

Cause she's money
Well she's silver and gold
Pure honey
So good for my soul
Whether rain or sunny
She’s money
She’s money baby

All the green that I need in her emerald eyes
I got empty pockets babe, but I still get by
My ride ain’t fancy but she don't care
That don't matter, long as it'll get us there
And that's why

Sh'’s money
Yeah, she’s silver and gold
Pure honey
Well, so good for my soul
Our love is free
She’s all that I need
Whether rain or sunny
She’s money

She's money
Well, she’s silver and gold
Pure honey
Well, so good for my soul

She's money
Well, she’s silver and gold
Pure honey
Well, so good for my soul
Our love is free
She's all that I need
Whether rain or sunny
She's money
The bluest skies don't seem so blue
And the stars seem to be a little dimmer too
Now that you're around you put 'em all to shame
Let me break it down cause what I'm trying to say is

No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

Gotta whole new direction it seems these days
I used to rush off to work and get home late but
Now I show up late and rush back home
My priorities are different, I can't leave you alone

No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

Girl if you ever get to guessing if I'm thinking about you
Just remember that

No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

I threw a wish in the well,
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell,
And now you're in my way

I'd trade my soul for a wish,
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this,
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holding,
Ripped jeans, skin was showin
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where do you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe?

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way

I beg, and borrow and steal
Have foresight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it,
But it's in my way

Your stare was holdin',
Ripped jeans, skin was showin
Hot night, wind was blowin
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad

You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too

Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted

Anyone can tell you you're pretty
You get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
Cause baby I wanna make you feel wanted

As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted

And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted
Yeah, baby I wanna make you feel
Wanted
Cause you'll always be wanted
 You're insecure 
Don't know what for 
You're turning heads when you walk through the door 
Don't need make up 
To cover up 
Being the way that you are is enough 

Everyone else in the room can see it 
Everyone else but you-ou-ou 

Baby you light up my world like nobody else 
The way you to flip your hair gets me overwhelmed 
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell 
You don't know (oh oh) 
You don't know you're beautiful! 
If only you saw what I can see 
You'll understand why I want you so desperately 
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe 
You don't know (oh oh) 
You don't know you're beautiful! 
That's what makes you beautiful! 
 
So come on 
You got it wrong 
To prove I'm right I put it in a so-o-ong 
I don't why 
You're being shy 
And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes 

Everyone else in the room can see it 
Everyone else but you 

Baby you light up my world like nobody else 
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed 
But when you smile at the ground it aint hard to tell

But you when smile at the ground it aint hard to tell

You don't know you're beautiful!

You don't know (oh oh) 
You don't know you're beautiful! 
You don't know you're beautiful! 

That's what makes you beautiful!
Girl I know I don’t know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin

I’m so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it’s going good

You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

Gonna cuss the morning when it comes
Cause I know that the rising sun
Ain’t no good for me
Cause you’ll have to leave

Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 3:35
There’s plenty of gas and the night’s still alive

You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

I don’t want this night to end
No I don’t want this night to end
I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time
Deep inside it was a rush, what a rush

Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way
About me, just too much, just too much

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it really just another crush?

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain’t going away
Going away

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hanging, spending time girl?
Are we just friends? Is there more? Is there more?

See it's a chance we've gotta take
Cause I believe that we can make this into
Something that will last, last forever, forever!

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we could be, where this thing could go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it really just another crush?

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain’t going away-ay-ay
Going away-ay-ay

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we could be, where this thing could go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it really just another crush?

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain’t going away
This crush ain't going away

Going away

[Pre-Chorus 2: Bruno Mars (B.o.B)]
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there to Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show (steal the show)
And just like that girl you got me froze (got me froze)

(Nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin on you babe, nuh-nuttin on you)
Yeaaaaah

Yeah, and that's just how we do it
Heheheh, and I'm a let this ride
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday (yeahh)

I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me "Do I look okay? "
I say

When I see your face (face face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face (face face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)

The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Did you see the sky? 
I think it means that we've been lost
Maybe one last time is all we need
I can't really help it 
If my tongue's all tied in knots
Jumping off a bridge is just the farthest 
That I've ever been

Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far

I know we're headed somewhere 
I can see how far we've come
But still I can't remember anything
Let's not do the wrong thing 
And I'll swear it might be fun
It's a long way down 
When all the knots we've tied have come undone

Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far

How you gonna ever find your place
Running in an artificial pace 
Are they gonna find us lying face down in the sand
So what the hell now we've already been forever damned

Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
It was seven hundred fenceposts from your place to ours
Neither one of us was old enough to drive a car
Sometimes it was raining, sometimes it would shine
We wore out that gravel road between your house and mine

I'd start walking your way
You'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle
Neath that old Georgia pine

We'd gain a lot of ground
Cause we'd both give a little
And their ain't no road to long
When you meet in the middle

It's been seven years tomorrow since we said our vows
Under that old pine tree, you ought to see it now
Standing in the back yard reminding me and you
That if we don't see eye to eye there's something we can do

I'd start walking your way
You'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle
Neath that old Georgia pine

We'd gain a lot of ground
Cause we'd both give a little
And their ain't no road to long
When you meet in the middle

Babe I love the way we work it out
That's what love's about

I'd start walking your way
You'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle
Neath that old Georgia pine

We'd gain a lot of ground
Cause we'd both give a little
And their ain't no road to long
When you meet in the middle

I'd start walking your way
You'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle
Neath that old Georgia pine

We'd gain a lot of ground
Cause we'd both give a little
And their ain't no road to long
When you meet in the middle

I'd start walking your way
You'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle
Neath that old Georgia pine

We'd gain a lot of ground
Cause we'd both give a little
And their ain't no road to long
When you meet in the middle
I don't want to spend another lonely night
Oooo oooo oooo
I've got the lights turned up
The door is locked the bedroom TV's on
Doing the only thing that gets me through the night
Since you've been gone

Prayin' for daylight waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight
Prayin for daylight

I made a bad miscalculation
Betting you would never leave
Cause if your getting on with your new life
Then where does that leave me

Repeat chorus

Prayin' for daylight
Prayin' for daylight

Bridge
Prayin for daylight
Hoping that I didn't wait too long
I didn't wait too long
That this is just the dark before the dawn

Deep in my heart I know
That you love me as much as I love you
And that you must be lying somewhere
Looking up to heaven too

Prayin' for daylight waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight
Prayin for daylight

Prayin' for daylight
I don't want to spend another lonely night
I don't want to spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight
Prayin' for daylight
I don't want to spend another lonely night
Oooo oooo oooo oooo oooo
Prayin' for daylight
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all
This is what you do.
This is what you do.
This is what you do.
This is what you do.

You make me want to leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you,
This is what you do.
I think about her and all the things that come along with
You make me,
You make me want to leave the one I'm with;
Start a new relationship with you,
This is what you do.
I think about her and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me

Before anything began between us,
You were like my best friend.
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems.
You used to say it'll be okay,
Suggest little nice things I should do.
And when I go home at night and lay my head down,
All I seem to think about was you,
And how

You make me want to leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you,
This is what you do.
I think about her and all the things that come along with
You make me,
You make me want to leave the one I'm with;
Start a new relationship with you,
This is what you do.
I think about her and all the things that come along with
You make me,
You make me

Now what's bad, is you're the one that hooked us up,
Knowing it should have been you.
What's sad is that I love her, but I'm falling for you;
What should I do?
Should I tell my baby, bye-bye?
Should I do exactly what I feel inside?
Cause I, I don't want to go, don't need to stay,
But I really need to get it together.

You make me want to leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you,
This is what you do.
I think about her and all the things that come along with
You make me,
You make me want to leave the one I'm with;
Start a new relationship with you,
This is what you do.
I think about her and all the things that come along with
You make me,
You make me

At this point the situation's out of control.
I never meant to hurt her,
But I gotta let her go.
And she may not understand it,
While all of this is going on.
I tried, I tried to fight it,
But the feeling's just too strong.

You make me, make me
You make me want to,
You make me want to,
You make me want to,
You make me want to,
You make me want to,
You make me want to,
You make me want to.
You makin' me
I, I'm driving black on black, just got my license back
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight

I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing

Screamin' no!
We're never gonna quit, ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go ‘cause everybody knows
We're just a couple animals

So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Check out the trouble we're in

You're beside me on the seat, got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears

By now, no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
‘Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch

I'm screamin' no!
We're never gonna quit ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go ‘cause everybody knows
We're just a couple animals

So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Look at the trouble we're in

We were parked out by the tracks, we're sitting in the back
And we just started getting busy when she whispered, “What was that?”
The wind, I think, ‘cause no one else knows where we are
And that was when she started screamin', “That's my dad outside the car!”

Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing

Screamin' no!
We're never gonna quit ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go ‘cause everybody knows
We're just a couple animals

So come on baby, get in
We're just a couple animals
Get in, just get in
(Ain't nothing wrong with it)
Check out the trouble we're in
We're just a couple animals
Get in, just get in

A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm colder

Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is

The kind of love 
That will last always 
I need somebody uplifting 
To take me away 

I want a lover who knows me 
Who understands how I feel inside 
Someone to comfort and hold me 
Through the long lonely nights 
Till the dawn 
Why don't you take me away

To disillusion me one more time 
Whispering words of forever 
Playing with my mind

The kind of love that won't fly away 
I just want someone to belong to 
Everyday 
Of my live 
Always 
So come and take me away

Won't you please come around 
Cause I wanna share forever with you baby
We've known each other
For a long long time But I never really noticed
All the magic in your eyes
I've been around you
A thousand times before
And you've always been a friend to me
But now I'm wanting more
I must have been so blind
I never realized
You're the one that's right for me
All the while I couldn't see
And now I feel so strange
I'll never be the same
Going 'round and 'round in circles
And I don't know what to do
'Cause baby

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

There's no explaining how I feel inside
I'm going thru a transformation
That's so hard for me to hide
I had a revelation that
Finally opened up my eyes
The one I spent a lifetime searching for
Was right here all the time
I was oblivious so very out of touch
All the while I couldn't see
You're the one that's right for me
And now my world has changed
I'll never be the same
Going 'round and 'round in circles
And it's all because of you
Sweet baby

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

Don't you know
That you're blowing my mind
What you do to me
I can't describe
Baby I can't hold back anymore
I just can't conceal it
You're the one I really adore

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I got your picture hanging on the wall
It can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

I read your letters when you're not near
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play the game, a fantasy
I pretend I'm not in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you phone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of being there

So let me get the real thing
So let me get the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies, my love
To the dark and the empty skies

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
And felt your heart beat close to mine
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command

And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time my love
It would last till the end of time my love

The first time ever I saw your face, your face
Your face, your face
Shadows fill an empty heart
As love is fading,
From all the things that we are
But are not saying.
Can we see beyond the stars
And make it to the dawn?

Change the colors of the sky.
And open up to
The ways you made me feel alive,
The ways I loved you.
For all the things that never died,
To make it through the night,
Love will find you.

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late,
What about now?

The sun is breaking in your eyes
To start a new day.
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace.
Shadows fade into the light.
I am by your side,
Where love will find you.

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love, it never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late,
What about now?

Now that we're here,
Now that we've come this far,
Just hold on.
There is nothing to fear,
For I am right beside you.
For all my life,
I am yours.

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late,
Baby, before it's too late,
Baby, before it's too late,
What about now?
Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
O baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours

Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours

Here I am baby
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)

Here I am baby,
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)

I've done alot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
Hey, hey, yea, yea, didn't i, oh baby

Seen alot of things in this old world
When I touched them they did nothing, girl
O baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours, oh I'm yours

Oo-wee babe you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you are my only desire
O baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours

Here I am baby
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)

Here I am baby,
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)

I've done alot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
I could be a broken man but here I am

With your future, got your future babe (here I am baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby, (here I am baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby, (here I am baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Oh darling 
I want to be everything to you 

You are everything 
You are my everything 

Today I saw somebody 
Who looked just like you 
He walked like you do 
I thought it was you 
As he turned the corner 
I called out your name 
I felt so ashamed 
When it wasn't you 
Wasn't you
You are everything 
And everything is you 
Oh, you are everything 
And everything is you 
Oh you are everything 
And everything is you 

How can I forget 
When each face that I see 
Brings back memories 
Of being with you 
I just can't go on 
Living life as I do 
Comparing each girl with you 
Knowing they just won't do
Why'd you tell me this
While you look for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be the one
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes of my own
You belong to me
In this life
Anyone could tell
Any fool can see who you need
I know you all too well
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes and I can tell

You belong to me
Tell him you were foolin'
You belong to me
You belong to me
Tell him he's a stranger
You belong to me
Lost and lonely lives
Drifting like waves at sea
We make it day by day
Watching the world go by

In a moment when time stands still
From here we look out on forever

Darling, our love
One love that never fades away
Our love
This love will light the world on its way

Shattered, hopeless dreams
Sifting like grains of sand
We claim it and here we stay
Watching the world go by

And with the strength that we spend in this life
In hope that it goes on forever
We believe as we promise to try, that

Darling, our love
One love that never fades away
Our love
This love will light the world on its way

In a moment when time stands still
From here we look out on forever
And we can see all that time will tell

Darling, our love
One love that never fades away
Our love
This love will light the world on its way
I know that you're afraid to love 
You've been hurt before 
Love broke your heart so you closed the door 
Now here I am outside your world, 
Wishin' you'd let me in 
Give me half a chance to prove you wrong 
Baby all your tears have come and gone 
Talkin' 'bout a brand new start 

Take it to heart, baby believe it 
This love is so strong that it won't let you go 
Baby hold on, you'll see just how good it's gonna be 
It's gonna be here long as you need it 
Never take your world and tear it apart 
Take it to heart baby 
 
You're gonna have to trust someone 
It's a shame if you don't 
Because it ain't no life living all alone 
Let me show you how to love again 
There's no broken heart that love won't mend 
Talkin' 'bout a brand new start 

I just want to be the one that'll be there by your side 
So take this love of mine 
Take it to heart 

Baby believe it, this love is so strong, love is so strong baby 

love is a second chance to find all that we lost 
Love's always worth a try no matter what the cost 
I know you don't believe your tears have come and gone 
Give me but half a chance and I will prove you wrong
Now baby

Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you
And it was plain to see, you were my destiny
With arms open wide, I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you, dedicate my life to you

I will go where you lead
Always there in times of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, you're all I need to get by

Like an eagle protects his nest
For you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree
Dare anybody to try and move me

Darling in you I found
Strength, when I was thrown down
Don't know what's in store
But together we can open any door

Just to do what's good for you
And inspire you a little bit higher
I know you can make a man
Out of a soul that didn't have a goal

'Cause we, we got the right foundation
And with the love and determination
You're all, you're all I want to strive for
And try a little more for

All, all the joys under the sun
Wrapped up into one
You're all, you're all I need, you're all I need
All, all, to get by
You're all I need

Baby, baby, baby, yeah, love
Oh, ooh, nothing baby, nothing baby
Ooh, true baby, oh no
Nothing in this world, no baby
Nothing, baby
Ooh, all I need
Baby, I need your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Although you're never near
Your voice I often hear

Another day
Another night
I long to hold you tight
Cause I'm so lonely

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losin' sleep

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Empty nights
Echo your name
Oh sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same? Oh yeah!

When you see me smile
You know things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see, darlin'
Has all been rehearsed
Darlin', I can't go on living without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
Loneliness inside me, baby
Makes me feel half alive

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
aybe you wanna give me kisses sweet 
But for only one night with no repeat 
Maybe you'll go away and never call 
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all 
In that case I don't want no part 
That would only break my heart 

But if you feel like loving me 
If you've got the notion 
I second that emotion 
Say if you feel like giving me 
A lifetime of devotion 
I second that emotion 

Maybe you think that love will tie you down 
And you don't have the time to hang around 
Maybe you think that love was made for fools 
And so it makes you wise to break the rules 
In that case I don't want no part 
'cause that would only break my heart 
But if you feel like loving me 
If you've got the notion 
I second that emotion 
Say if you feel like giving me 
A lifetime of devotion 
I second that emotion 

In that case I don't want no part 
That would only break my heart 

But if you feel like loving me 
If you've got the notion 
I second that emotion 
But if you feel like giving me 
A lifetime of devotion 
I second that emotion 

But if you feel like giving me 
A lifetime of devotion 
I second that emotion
Remember me before we met
Every night and day
I had to live the life
Of a lonely one

And I remember meeting you
Discovering love could be true
It shared by two
Instead of one

When you said you loved me and want me
And we could not be parted
Said, I built my world around you
Ever since I found you, darling

Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, now baby
Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, baby

Each day I pray we'll never part
For the love within my heart
Grows stronger baby, day to day

And best I came, I always try
To reassure and satisfy
You know, I'll be lost
If you went away

When you said you loved me and want
And we could not be parted
When I built my world around, baby
Ever since I found you

Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, baby
Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever and ever

When you said you loved me
And we could not be parted
Said I built my world around you
Ever since I found you, baby

Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, no no baby
Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than, sweeter than ever now baby, baby

Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, ever
Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, ever

Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, ever
Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, ever

Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever
Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever
I was born in Lil' Rock,
Had a childhood sweetheart,
We were always hand in hand

I was hightop shoes and shirt tails,
Suzy was in pig tails,
I know I loved her even then

You know my papa disapproved it,
My mama boohooed it,
But I told them time and time again,
"Don't you know I was made to love her,
Built a world around her
Yah! Hey, hey, hey

She's been my inspiration,
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years.

Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly,
My love grew sweeter through the years

I know that my baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
That's why we made it through the years

I was made to love her,
Worship and adore her,
Hey, hey, hey

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end,
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby

My baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
And I know I ain't going nowhere

I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me,
I had the fever with each passing year

Oh, even if the mountain tumbles,
If this whole world crumbles,
By her side I'll still be standing there

'Cause I was made to love her,
I was made to live for her, yeah!

Ah, I was made to love her,
Built my world all around her,
Hey, hey, hey

Oo baby, I was made to please her,
You know Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no,
Hey, hey, hey

Oo wee baby, my baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
Hey, hey, hey
Baby, baby, you don't understand
How much I love you, baby
How much I want to be
Your only man, oh, baby, my baby, my baby

And baby, baby, baby, you don't have to go
Stay a little while longer, baby
I want to talk to you
Just a little more

I see the tears in your eyes about to fall
You are wondering if I'm for real
Oh, but if you cry, I wonder why you cry
I tell you no lie, this is how I feel

You need to, baby, I'm for real
So real, baby, baby, baby, baby, girl

And baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, you don't have to go
Stay a little while longer, baby, hold me, baby, love me, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is how I feel about your love, yeah
But if you cry, I wonder why you cry
I tell you, tell you no lie, this is how I feel
Oh, now, baby, now, baby, now, baby, yeah

Baby, I'm for real (I'm for real)
You know (I'm for real)
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know

(Baby, I'm for real)
You know I'm not lyin' to you, baby
I would never, never tell you a lie about my love
(Baby, I'm for real)
I'm so for real, I'm so for real, I'm, I'm real, I'm real

But if you wanna know the truth about it
Girl, I just can't live without it
And that's why I'm professin' my love to you, baby
So that I can live my whole life with you

And baby, baby, baby
Never, never, never gonna leave you, baby
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh, baby, I'm for real
(Baby, I'm for real)
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Now you won't have to cry, no

(Baby, I'm for real)
And darling, hey, hey, baby

Take to the sky on a natural high
Lovin' you more till the die I die
Take to the sky on a natural high
Lovin' you, kissin' you, tellin' you why

(Baby, I'm for real)
Oh, you need to know, you need to know, oh
Baby, I'm for real

(Baby, I'm for real)
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Now you won't have to cry, no, no

Ooh, yeah
Your love, lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it it up
Quench my desire
And I'll be at your side, forever more

You know your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)

Now once I was down hearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
But then you came and it soon departed
And you know he never
Showed his face again

That's why
You know your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)

I'm so glad, I've finally found you
Yes, that one, in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
Honey, I can stand up and face the world

You know your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost

I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change
And I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours we both know
We know, they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run from that, say you’re done with that
On your face girl, it just don’t show
When you’re ready, just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the party's over, just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry,
You won’t ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

Cause if you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost

It’s my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Cause your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know, you hate being alone
You ain’t the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
When they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin’ to save you
Instead they say,
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost
You think I'm pretty
Without any makeup on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punchline wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me
I was alright but things
Were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance, until we die
You and I, will be young forever

You make me feel
Like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and
Built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance, until we die
You and I, will be young forever

You make me feel
Like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

I'm a get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

You make me feel
Like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

I'm a get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was

Now here we are
So close yet so far
Haven't I passed the test
When will you realize
Baby, I'm not like the rest

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

On Sunday you went home alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love
But you did not reply

The world is ours if we want it
We can take it if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby, try to understand

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break

There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

When your lips are on my lips
And our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run, whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong

Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break
(Let me give your heart a break)

'Cause you've been hurt before
I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile it away, some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart
Maybe, I can ease the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break

There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
Forever can never be long enough for me
To feel like I've had long enough with you
Forget the world now, we won't let them see
But there's one thing left to do

Now that the weight has lifted
Love has surely shifted my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe

Say you will
Say you will

Together can never be close enough for me
To feel like I am close enough to you
You wear white and I'll wear out the words I love you
And you're beautiful

Now that the wait is over
And love and has finally showed her my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe

Say you will
Say you will

Promise me you'll always be
Happy by my side
I promise to sing to you
When all the music dies

And marry me
Today and everyday
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe

Say you will
Say you will
Marry me
I was all alone
I was feeling rather low
I needed someone to lift my spirits up
So I dropped in on a dance
Just to take a glance
And there this lovely thing was
She was more than enough
I asked her for her hand
Said would you like to dance
So pleased that I had asked
She quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam
Ohhh

Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me
Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me
Seems what you say is true
I feel the same way too
I waited all night long just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand
I knew you were the man
To turn my world around
And make my dreams come true
The magic in your eyes, made me realize
That everything I feel, has got to be real
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam

I'm trying to find someone who
I can give my good lovin' to
Never, ever did I dream I'd find someone, yeah

Now I've been trying to find someone too
I prayed to God, and then I found you
I swear I fell in love the night you danced into my heart

Play another slow jam
This time make is sweet
On a slow jam
Can I get a slow jam
Do you want to slow jam, baby
Play another slow jam

Craving your body all through the night
Feels like I'm going through withdraws

I want you inside of these of these arms
I'm dying to taste you, I can't deny
Can't get out of my mind
Please let me hold you
Cause I need your lovin' tonight

Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you

Homie lover friend is what I'm looking for
Some one who can relate to what I have in store

I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart you'd find
A girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone

I wanna run to you (oooh)
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms 
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you (oooh)
But if I come to you (oooh)
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away

Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there, no one cares for me 
What's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share it with
Tell me what does it mean?

I wanna run to you (oooh)
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms 
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you (oooh)
But if I come to you (oooh)
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away

I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears
If you only knew how much...

I wanna run to you (oooh)
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms 
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you (oooh)
But if I come to you (oooh)
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away
A few stolen moments is all that we share 
You've got your family, and they need you there 
Though I've tried to resist, being last on your list 
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy, living all alone 
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own 
But each time I try, I just break down and cry 
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue 
So I'm saving all my love for you 

You used to tell me we'd run away together 
Love gives you the right to be free 
You said be patient, just wait a little longer 
But that's just an old fantasy 
I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more 
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door 
For tonight is the night, for feeling alright 
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love 
Yes I'm saving all my love 
Yes I'm saving all my love for you 

No other woman, is gonna love you more 
Cause tonight is the night, that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love 
Yeah I'm saving all my love 
Yes I'm saving all my love for you 
For you, for you
I can't get you off my mind 
No matter what I do 
I'm wishing you were here, with me 
It makes no difference 
I only think of you 
And I living out my fantasy 

Late at night, a rendezvous 
Being such a love sick fool 
It might be pouring rain 
But still the same, nothings changed 
All and all I feel no shame 
I'm just your fool the same 
(I'm just your fool) 
(I keep thinking about you baby) 
So tell me what you're gonna do 
(I keep thinking about you) 
All I wanna do is 
(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind 
I'm thinking about you) 
That's what I wanna do 
(Pick me up, let's go down 
I'm thinking about it too) 
(I'm thinking about you) 
Ya got me thinking about you 
(I'm thinking about it too) 

Maybe weeping is a game 
That's hard for me to face 
(But you need me) 
Just like I need you 
There's no reason 
Just my heart that makes me feel this way 
And I hope you feel the same way too 

Late at night, a rendezvous 
Being such a love sick fool 
It might be pouring rain 
But still the same, nothings changed 
All and all I feel no shame 
I'm just your fool the same 
(I'm just your fool) 
(I keep thinking about you baby) 
So tell me what you're gonna do 
(I keep thinking about you) 
All I wanna do is 
(Like a river of wine, intoxicate my mind 
I'm thinking about you) 
That's what I wanna do 
(Pick me up, let's go down 
I'm thinking about it too) 
(I'm thinking about you) 
Ya got me thinking about you 
(I'm thinking about it too) 

It might be pouring rain 
But like a fool, insane 
I run to you 
I'm just a love sick fool 
I've got this thing for you (I'm just a love-sick fool) 

Late at night, a rendezvous

(I'm thinking about you) 
Ya got me thinking about you 
(I'm thinking about it too) 
I bet you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let it go
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well, I'm in a daze from your love you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let it go
Some people go around the world of love
But they may never find what they dream of
What you won't do, oh, do it for love
You've tried everything but you don't give up
In my world only you, make me do for love what I would not do
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
I'm in a daze from your love you see
And I, I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let it go, oh, yeah

You know I only want the best is true
If you believe the things I do for you
What you won't do, oh, come on and do it for love
You've tried everything but you don't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love what I would not do
Whenever I'm weary from the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness when my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way but still you seem to understand
Now and forever I will be your man.

Sometimes I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune that heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever I will be your man

Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore
If I'd only known you were there all the time
All this time

Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand
Now and forever I will be your man
Now and forever I will be your man
Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

I had a dream I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
A helping hand - some one who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say I'll show you

Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

So you think you know the answers - oh no
'cause the whole world has got you dancing
That's right - I'm telling you
It's time to start believing - oh yes
Believing who you are - you are a shining star

Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally
So I found me a little thing 
Wanna keep me up all night 
She told me don't be so uptight 
She wanna keep up all night 
Damn she might kill me 

I found me a pretty little thing 
Wanna keep me up all night 
She says she gonna make things all right 
She wanna keep me up all night 
Damn she might kill me 

I'm in Brazil where the scene so fire 
Where the girls and trees can get hotter 
Everything that I see talks to me 
Can't believe how the girls be walking 

I've been here about an hour 
They keep saying come talk to me 
I keep thinking there's one and they say us three 
Standing there getting out of the shower 
Turning around showing me the thing got power 

Started to converse and I sense a problem 
And I'm thinking girl I can always solve them 
But she didn't want to hear it 
She says she is all mine and I can make him feel it 
All along I was thinking it was gonna be her plus two 
Now they're looking like Lionel the joke's on you 
Next thing I'm feeling is her up and down 
While the girls are watching 

So I found me a little thing 
Wanna keep me up all night 
She told me don't be so uptight 
She wanna keep up all night 
Damn she might kill me 

I found me a pretty little thing 
Wanna keep me up all night 
She says she gonna make things all right 
She wanna keep me up all night 
Damn she might kill me 

I thought there ain't a thing I ain't seen 
Until she pulled out a banner for me 
She said whatever you want 
I know I needed a little vacation 
But now I may never go home 

So I found me a little thing

I've been here about an hour 
They keep saying come talk to me 
I keep thinking there's one and they say us three 
Standing there getting out of the shower 
Turning around showing me the thing got power
Here I finally come to stand 
My pen and paper in hand 
To write to you 

To tell you what I feel inside 
To say to you I can't survive 
Without you 

For all the things I've come to see 
I now beleive there's only you 
Only you for me 

I'm standing here so lost in you 
That's all my heart and soul can do 
Is say what's true 

I love you 
I love you 

The first time I looked in your eyes 
It was so clear to my surprise 
My heart stood still 

I'v eheard it time and time again 
That when you fall you can't pretend 
True love is real 

I know with you I do belong 
You are my voice my simple song 
You're all I need 

The joy I feel when love is blind 
You're everything I need to find 
My search is through 

Babe I love you 
I love you 
Babe I love you 
I love you 

Cause I know with you I do belong 
You are my voice my simple song 
You're all I need 

And the joy I feel when love is blind 
You're everything I need to find 
My search is through 

Babe I love you 
I love you
I've been alone with you
Inside my mind
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips
A thousand times
I sometimes see you
Pass outside my door
Hello!
Is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again
How much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello!
I've just got to let you know
Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying I love you

Hello!
Is it me you're looking for?
'cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying I love you
Are you feeling down, and lonely.
Feeling like you can't go on.
Just remember love will find a way.

Tell me are you going through changes.
Time seems like it's passing by.
Just believe that love will find a way.

I see the tears you cry.
I see the pain that's in your eyes.
So many times you were so lonely.
And no one seemed to care.
But if your hopes, for your tomorrows.
Are drowning in your sorrows.
Know your heart will show you the way.

Are you trying to find a beginning.
Or something just to hold on to.
Always know that love will find a way.

Is it hard this life you're living.
Does the world seem so unkind.
Don't you worry love will find a way.

Some say we've lost, our way.
Some say the world has gone astray.
But if you know where you're going.
There's nothing you can't do.
'cause problems will come.
And they will leave you.
The world will try to deceive you.
But the truth will always be in your soul.
I used to cry myself to sleep at night 
But that was all before he came 
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right 
But now he's here 
It's not the same, it's not the same 

He fills me up 
He gives me love 
More love than I've ever seen 
He's all I've got, 
He's all I've got in this world 
But he's all the man that I need 

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes 
He takes me down and rocks me slow 
And in the evening when the moon is high 
He holds me close and won't let go 
He won't let go 

He fills me up 
He gives me love 
More love than I've ever seen 
He's all I've got, 
He's all I've got in this world 
But he's all the man that I need 
As I lay me down,
Heaven hear me now.
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all.

Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun.
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?

I look to you.
I look to you.
After all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you.

About to lose my breathe,
There's no more fighting left,
Sinking to rise no more,
Searching for that open door.

And every road that I've taken
Lead to my regret.
And I don't know if I'm going to make it.
Nothing to do but lift my head

I look to you.
I look to you.
After all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you.

My levees are broken
My walls have come
Tumbling down on me

The rain is falling.
Defeat is calling.
I need you to set me free.

Take me far away from the battle.
I need you.
Shine on me.

I look to you.
I look to you.
After all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you.
I found out what I've been missin'
Always on the run
I've been lookin' for someone

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

That you give good love to me, Baby
So good, take this of heart mine into your hands
You give good love to me
(You give good love to me)
Never too much
(Never too much, will never be)
Baby you give good love

(Haa)
Never stoppin' I was always searchin'
For that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

You give good love to me, Baby
So good, take this of heart mine into your hands
You give good love to me
(You give good love to me)
Its never too much

Feel I can, feel I can, do anything for you baby 
I will fly for you baby, hold on and enjoy the ride

You've given me ecstasy

All my life I've longed for this
Someone who makes me happy
Let's seal this moment with a kiss

But I'm back on top
And I'm feelin' the rhythm
As we start to rock
When ya get down to it
I belong to you

Though I'm not afraid to let it show
I'll tell the world I want everyone to know
There's nobody who does me like you do

All of my love is yours tonight
I live to make you happy
Nothin' has ever felt so right
I want it all
And nothin's gonna stop me cuz'

I've been to the bottom
But I'm back on top
And I'm feelin' the rhythm
As we start to rock
When ya get down to it
I belong to you

When you touch me tender
And you reach my soul
When I start to weaken
And I lose control
When you get down to it
I belong to you

I've been to the bottom
But I'm back on top
And I'm feelin' the rhythm
As we start to rock
When ya get down to it
I belong to you
I hope that you realize baby, just what you mean to me 
Hey you where I run for cover, your loving shelter for me 
And when I find myself needing some lifting up 
One night with you and that always is enough 
Hey you make being in love, a true rare affair 
So take me I'm your prisoner 

Will you sentence me to be your lover for life 
Your lover for life 
Will you sentence me, I want to be you lover for life 
Your lover for life 

I just want to hear you say 
You'll be my lover, lover for life 
Capture, there's no getaway 
You're my lover, my lover for life 

Under your spell or under my own power 
It really doesn't matter to me 
See I fell in love the first time I saw you 
And have been falling in love ever since 

You heard my testimony, you've seen my evidence 
Hey, it's a crime of passion, in every sense 
And justice won't be served, till you stay here in my world 
Take me I'm your prisoner 

Will you sentence me to be your lover for life 
Your lover for life 
Will you sentence me, I want to be you lover for life 
Your lover for life 
We didn't know we didn't know 
Since I don't know when 
We've been only friends 
No more but no less 
Our friendship we had at best 

A voice to console 
An ear to confide 
That someone you tell 
Your deepest of feelings inside 

But we didn't know 
When we held each other 
It would feel so right 
We didn't know 
On that night we'd be falling in love 
I looked at you 
You looked at me 
In ways we never thought we would be 
But like tomorrow's today's mystery 
We didn't know 

Be it big, be it small 
On you I could call 
Nothing but to ask 
You'd be right there in a flash 
A hand I could hold 
That friend I could trust 
But the love that we shared 
Was just platonic between us 

But we didn't know 
When we held each other 
It would feel so right 
We didn't know 
On that night we'd be falling in love 
I looked at you 
You looked at me 
In ways we never thought we would be 
But like tomorrow's today's mystery 
We didn't know

That's what happens 
When innocent friends 
Turn serious lovers 
And we're so happy that 
We've fallen in love 
And still can be best of friends 

When they'd break your heart 
And when they'd make you cry 
We both would confer 
You should give love one more try 

We've searched everywhere 
For true love to find 
Yet who'd think it was us 
That we were longing for all the time 

Cause we didn't know 
When we held each other 
It would feel so right 
We didn't know 
On that night we'd be falling in love 
I looked at you 
And you looked at me 
In ways we never thought 
We would be 
But just like the future 
No one can see 
We didn't know 

But we didn't know 
When we held each other 
It would feel so right 
We didn't know 
On that night we'd be falling in love 
I looked at you 
You looked at me 
In ways we never thought we would be 
But like tomorrow's today's mystery 
We didn't know
I've been waiting such a long time
For a love that's real to come my way
Gonna take some getting used to
Now that love is here to stay

After we make love, I'll be lost in the afterglow
You're all I'm dreaming of, I just can't, I just can't let the feeling go
After we make love, there's no doubt in my mind I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow, all that matters is right here and now

Now the world is filled with wonder
You turned my life around in just one day
I love the spell you put me under
With just one kiss you take my breath away

After we make love, feels so good to be lost in the afterglow
You're all I'm dreaming of, I just can't, I just can't let the feeling go
After we make love, there's no doubt in my mind I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow, all that matters is right here and now

All those lonely days and nights
Were well worth going through
I'm so glad I never gave my heart away
It's like I've waited all my life
So I can give it all to you

I've been waiting such a long time
For a love that's real to come my way
It's gonna take some getting used to
Now that love is here to stay

After we make love, feels so good to be lost in the afterglow
After we make love, I just can't, I just can't let the feeling go
After we make love, there's no doubt in my mind I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow, all that matters is right here and now
All that matters is right here and now
We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're okay
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then I wanna feel that way again

Been so long that you'd forget the way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me, remind me
So on fire so in love. Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me, remind me

Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
I felt bad cause you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night

Do you remember how it used to be
We'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep
Remind me, baby, remind me
Oh, so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
Remind me, baby, remind me

I wanna feel that way
Yeah, I wanna hold you close
Oh, if you still love me
Don't just assume I know

Baby, remind me, remind me

Do you remember the way it felt?
You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves
Remind me
Yeah, remind me
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me, oh, baby, remind me

Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me

Oh, baby, remind me

Oh, baby, remind me, baby, remind me
Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
Remind me, yeah, oh
Baby, remind me
While we’re young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Treat me like I’m special
Cover me with sweetness
Cause the time will come 
when we’re not so young and beautiful

While we’re young and beautiful
Livin’ free and easy
Here without a worry
Dancin’ in our barefeet
Cause when the summer’s done
We might not be so young and beautiful

It’s a crazy ride, baby you and I 
are keepin’ our sweet love alive tonight
While we’re young and beautiful

While we’re young and beautiful
We’ll party down on main street
Wearing next to nothin’
Feelin’ every heartbeat
Having fun
While we’re still young and beautiful

It’s a crazy ride, baby you and I 
are keepin’ our sweet love alive tonight
While we’re young and beautiful

Beautiful, beautiful young and beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful young and beautiful

It’s a crazy ride, baby you and I 
are keepin’ our sweet love alive tonight
While we’re young and beautiful

Oh, so beautiful

While we're young and beautiful 
cover me with sweetness

While we're young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Like you mean it
Like you mean it
Like you mean it 
Like you do

Ohhhh, yeah
So beautiful
I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been

Then you come on crashing in
Like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand
All that your love can bring

Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind
To tell you that I can't keep lovin' you, can't keep lovin' you
Oh, with half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself

Lonely was the song I sang
'Til the day you came
Showing me another way
And all that my love can bring

Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind
To tell you that I can't keep lovin' you, can't keep lovin' you
Oh, with half of my heart, with half of my heart

Your faith is strong, but I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you
Than half of my heart

But I can't stop lovin' you, I can't stop lovin' you
I can't stop lovin' you, I can't stop lovin' you,
I can't stop lovin' you with half of my
Half of my heart, oh half of my heart

Half of my heart's got a real good imagination
Half of my heart's got you
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That half of my heart won't do

Half of my heart is a shot gun wedding
To a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man
Who's never truly loved anything

Half of my heart, oh half of my heart
Half of my heart, oh half of my heart
Half of my heart, oh half of my heart
alk about love, talk about trust
Talkin' 'bout forever baby
When I'm talkin' 'bout us

I give you my word, stick to my guns
Believe me when I tell ya baby
That we've just begun

You don't understand, no
The full intent of my plan

I want to be your soul provider
I want to stay that way
For the longest time
I want to be, your sould provider
Justsay you'll let me
And darlin' I will

I know you've been hurt, I know you're love shy
You don't have to say it baby
It's gonna take some time
Ya got my heart, in the palm of your hand
Swear it's gonna stay there baby
Give me half a chance

You don't understand 
The full intent of my plan

I've been waitin' for a long time for somebody like you
To give my love, all my love day and night
Just say you'll be mine for the rest of your life
Baby I'll show you why

I want to be your soul provider
I want to stay that way
For the longest time
I want to be, your sould provider
Justsay you'll let me
And darlin' I will
In the night I hear you speak
Turn around, you're in my sleep
Feel your hands inside my soul
You're holding on and you won't let go

I've tried running, but there's no escape
Can't bend them, and I just can't break these

Steel bars, wrapped all around me
I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
I'm bound forever till the end of time
Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine

Trying hard to recognize
See the face behind the eyes
Feel your haunting ways like chains
'Round my heart they still remain

Steel bars, wrapped all around me
I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
I'm bound forever till the end of time
Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine

And with every step I take
Every desperate move I make
It's clear to me
What can all my living mean
When time itself is so obscene
When time itself don't mean a thing?
I'm still loving you

Steel bars, wrapped all around me
I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
I'm bound forever till the end of time
Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine
There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be
Lived with you, lived with you
There's a way
Everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got you?

You don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody
The way I love you

In my mind
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind, so very blind
I'm a man
Can't you see what I am?
I live and breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, ain't got you?

Oh yeah
You don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody
To love somebody, oh yeah

To love somebody
The way I love you
You don't know, you don't know
To love somebody, to love somebody
You don't know, oh
To love somebody, to love somebody
The way I love you
I've got this somethin' to tell you
There ain't no doubt in my mind
All I'm askin' is to keep you near forever
Just till the end of time

Baby I know where love grows
My heart is overflowin'
You're so fine and so true
I wanna spend my time, spendin' time with you, baby

I've got the best of love
With every breath and every beat of my heart
You know you've got me by my deepest emotion
'Cause you keep givin' me the best of love

Passion and sweet inspiration
So rare and so hard to find
You are my journey and my destination
Queen of this heart of mine

Baby I know where love grows
In my life it's overflowin'
You're so fine and it's so true
I know I've got it all, all because of you, baby

I've got the best of love
With every breath and every beat of my heart
You know ya reach into my deepest emotion
And you keep givin' me, the best of love

With every moment that passes by
This love goes on
It keeps growin' stronger
And the more we're together
The best keeps getting better, baby

I've got the best of love
With every breath and every beat of my heart
You know you're down inside my deepest emotion
So just keep givin' me, the best of love

I've got the best of love
With every breath and every beat of my heart
Ain't nothin' finer than that sweetest emotion
Just keep givin' me, just keep on givin' me
The best of love, best of love, best of love
Baby is the pressure of knowing that
I'm watching you perform
Or maybe you're not used to someone who knows exactly what you want

I know the fire's burnin', but baby there's no need to be alarmed
And you can be the rain that's fallin, girl and I'll be the thunderstorm
Oh yeah

You got no need to be nervous
Because you are safe in my hands
I'm sure you'll be needin' my service
Baby your wish will be my command

Cause I'll touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down

I promise you ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't goin'
Nowhere, girl not until
You let me lay you down in here

When you're cold, I wanna be the one that keeps you warm
I'll make your body come to me, pull you back when you try to run, baby
Baby I'll go deep, open up if you're ready for me to feed cha
And let me tell you who you are? Let me taste it, you can take it
It's goin' down right here.

Cause I'll touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down

I promise you ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't goin'
Nowhere, girl not until
You let me lay you down in here

All that I want
Is to squeeze you, touch you, kiss you, baby
And I'll provide you with that
Special kind of lovin'
You goin' nowhere
(You ain't goin nowhere)

I'll show you what love is
If you let me lay you down

I promise you ain't goin'
Nowhere, nowhere
You ain't goin'
No, you won't be sorry
You ain't goin'
Nowhere, girl not until
You let me lay you down in here

When you be putting your heels on
I swear your body's so perfect baby
How you work it baby yea

Girl give me something to feel on
So please believe we gone be twerking it out
By the end of the night baby

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon hear me say

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl

Loving everything you do

And you in the place girl
Feel like I'm in a movie baby
I'm like oowee baby oh
Like waterfalls your hair falls down to your waist
Can I get a taste girl
No need to keep this baby
I ain't ashamed of calling your name girl

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon hear me say

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl

There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
O girl look at you
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey 

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated 

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey 

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me 

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way 

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated 

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 
Just do your thang honey!

I could feel it from the start,
Couldn't stand to be apart
Something about you caught my eye,
Something moved me deep inside!
Don't know what you did boy but
You had it and I've been hooked ever since
I told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friend
I told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense
Everytime I see you everything starts making sense

Just do your thang honey!

Ain't no other man, can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
(what you do)
You're the kinda guy, a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style with your bad ass - oh yeah!
Ain't no other man its true - all right
Ain't no other man but you

Just do your thang honey!

Never thought I'd be all right. No, no, no!
Till you came and changed my life. Yeah, yeah, yeah!
What was cloudy now is clear! Yeah, yeah!
You're the light that I needed.
You got what I want boy, and I want it!
So keep on givin' it up

Tell your mother, your brother, your sister, and your friend.
And the others, your lovers, better not be present tense.
Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine and no one else's!

Oooooooo, oh

Ain't no other man, can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
(what you do).
You're the kinda guy, a girl finds in a blue moon.
You got soul, you got class.
You got style your bad ass - oh yeah!
Ain't no other man it's true, all right
Ain't no other man but you

Break it down now!

Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other! (other)
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other LOVER!
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other!
Ain't no other man but you!

Ohhhh!

You are there when I'm a mess
Talk me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy you're the best
You're the only one who's ever passed every test

Ain't no other man, can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
(what you do)
You're the kinda guy, a girl finds in a blue moon.
(You're the kinda guy, a girl finds oooo yeahh)
You got soul, you got class
You got style your bad ass, oh yeah
Ain't no other man it's true - all right
Ain't no other man but you

And now I'm tellin' you, so ain't no other man but you.

Ain't no other man, can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
(what you do)
You're the kinda guy, a girl finds in a blue moon.
You got soul, you got class
You got style your bad ass - oh yeah!
Ain't no other man it's true - all right
Ain't no other man but you.
Maybe it's intuition 
But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes
I see my future in an instant
and there it goes
I think I've found my best friend
I know that it might sound more than
a little crazy but I believe 

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life 

There's just no rhyme or reason
only this sense of completion
and in your eyes
I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for
I think I found my way home
I know that it might sound more than
a little crazy but I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life 

A thousand angels dance around you
I am complete now that I found you 

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life 
Anytime I need to see your face I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal minds and magenta feelings
Take up shelter in the base of my spine
Sweet like a chica cherry cola
I don't need to try to explain
I just hold on tight and If it happens again 
I may move so slightly to the arms
And the lips and the face
Of The Human Cannonball that
I need to I want to

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when
I get to you

Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out

I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy getting perfect is what I live for
But a look and then a smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place in the interaction
Of a lover and a mate but the time of talking
Using symbols, using words can be likened 
To a deep sea diver who is swimming with a raincoat

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when
I get to you

Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out

Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

Anytime I need to see your face I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal minds and magenta feelings
Take up shelter in the base of my spine
Sweet like a chica cherry cola
I don't need to try to explain
I just hold on tight and If it happens again 
I may move so slightly to the arms
And the lips and the face
Of The Human Cannonball that
I need to I want to
I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire
You come to me, come to me wild and wild
When you come to me
Give me everything I need
Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
Speak a language of love like you know what it means
And it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong baby

You're simply the best, better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met
I'm stuck on your heart, and hang on every word you say
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead

In your heart I see the star of every night and every day
In your eyes I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place

You're simply the best, better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met
I'm stuck on your heart, and hang on every word you say
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead

Each time you leave me I start losing control
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when I'm alone
Oh baby, don't let go
Sitting in my class, just drifting away
Staring into the windows of the world
I can't hear the teacher, his books don't call me at all
I don't see the bad boys tryin' to catch some play

'cause I love your smile
I love your smile

The clock at work says three
And I wanna be free
Free to scream, free to bathe, free to paint
My toes all day
My boss is lame you know, and so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway

'cause I love your smile
I love your smile

Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl with love you give
You rock my world
You dig

I'm showin'
The life that I'm livin'
This is the life that I have
And it's given to you

Yeh'and it's true
La-d-da
Twinkley d
do you

Believe in a girl
like me
Shanice is the one
For you to be with

But when I'm caught
All alone
I start fessin'
It's from a state of depression
And the thunder clouds of doubt move in
I begin to wonder "Do you still love me?"
But after that
My whole world is beautiful

Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl with love you give
You rock my world
You dig

Smile... Psych!

Cause I love your smile
I love your smile
I’ve never been so sure
About anything before
But this loving feeling
Gonna be a feeling I feel forever more

Looking in your eyes
Tomorrow’s all I see
Long as there’s forever, baby
I will always be

Saving forever for you, oh oh oh
You are the only one
I’ll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won’t do, oh oh oh
Wanna always stay together
So I’m saving forever for you


You’ll be my world
As long as there’s a world turning round
And you’ll be my heaven
Baby, till the heavens all come falling down

Look inside my heart (Oh, yeah)
Love is all you’ll see
Loving you forever,
Living just to be

Saving forever for you, oh oh oh
You are the only one
I’ll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won’t do, oh oh oh
Wanna always stay together
So I’m saving forever for you

Forever I’ll be loving you
Long as time passes by
I’ll be there beside you, ho
Through it all, I’ll be standing by you

Saving forever for you, oh oh oh
You are the only one
I’ll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won’t do, oh oh oh
Wanna always stay together
So I’m saving forever, saving forever for you

Saving forever for you (Hoo…ooh…ooh…)
You are the only one
I’ll ever give forever to (You are the only one)
Love for a lifetime won’t do, (oh oh oh)
Wanna always stay together
So I’m saving forever for you, for you

Saving forever
Saving forever for you
Saving forever, (Saving forever)
Saving forever for you
Saving forever, (Saving forever)
Saving forever for you
Saving forever, (Saving forever)
Saving forever for you
If I never knew you
If i never felt this love
I would have no inkling of
How precious life can be

And if I never held you
I would never have a clue
How at last I'd find in you
The missing part of me

In this world so full of fear
Full of rage and lies
I can see the truth so clear
In your eyes
So dry your eyes

And I'm so grateful to you
I'd hve lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you

If I never knew you
I'd be safe but half as real
Never knowing I could feel
A love so strong and true

I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you

I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright
I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
all they'd leave us were these wispers in the night
But still my heart is saying we were right

Oh if I never knew you
There's no moment I regret
If i never felt this love
Since the moment that we met
I would have no inkling of
If our time has gone too fast
How precious life can be
I've lived at last

I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright
I thought our love wuold be so beautiful
We'd turn the darkness into light
And still my heart is saying we were right
we were right

And if I never knew you
If I never knew you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Empty as the sky
Never knowing why
Lost forever
If I never knew you
Yeah yeah yeah

Darlin, here we are again,
Right about now, 
There is no need too tell you what I'm feelin'
I'm so grateful, 
To have a man like you,
Who knows what to do,
Makes me feel like a woman should
Ooohh yeah

When I close my eyes, 
I break down and cry, 
It's somethin 'bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss, 
My heart can't resist,
It's all about the way you love me

Never thought that I would fin
So much peace of mind,
And every moment that share with yo
Sometimes I don't know why
We fell so deep in love
But then it all comes back to me because

When I close my eyes, 
I break down and cry, 
It's somethin 'bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss, 
My heart can't resist,
It's all about the way you love me

When I'm with you, 
I feel so good
No one loves me like you

When I close my eyes

When I close my eyes, 
I break down and cry, 
It's somethin 'bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss, 
My heart can't resist,
It's all about the way you love me

When I close my eyes, 
I break down and cry, 
It's somethin 'bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss, 
My heart can't resist,
It's all about the way you love me

When I close my eyes, 
I break down and cry, 
It's somethin 'bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss, 
My heart can't resist,
It's all about the way you love me
Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
Don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait

Oh baby I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
Wanna be with you night and day

Moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some firefly
Wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
I can see them under the pine
Don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait

Oh baby I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, oh
Wanna be with you night and day, oh yeah

Well don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait

I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and gray, blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one
Out of season

Don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait

Oh baby I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day

Oh baby I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day, yeah
Ooh baby, anytime my world gets crazy
All I have to do, to calm it
Is just think of you

Cause when I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

I just get more attached to you when
You hold me in your arms, and squeeze me
And you leave me making me blue

Cause when I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

So in love
(So in love)
Ooh
(So in love)
With you
(So in love)
Baby
(So in love)
Ooh
(So in love)
Hee
(So in love)
With you
(So in love)
(So in love)

When I think of you
When I think of you
When I think of you
When I think of you

Bass
I'm so in love
I just think of you
If you're not around
Oh
When I think of you

(So in love)
Ooh
(So in love)
So in love
(So in love)
With you
(So in love)
Baby you
(So in love)
Ooh
(So in love)
So in love
(So in love)
With you
(So in love)
Break.

(Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, cha, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, chow!)

Ah
Hahahaha
Feels so good
When I think of you
Yeah-e-yeah
I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
Oh no
But I don't know about that
There's many times that we've loved
We've shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough
There's just not enough of it
There's just not enough
Oh oh, babe

My darling, I can't get enough of your love babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love babe
Oh, some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
Just like the more you give, the more I want
And baby, that's no lie
Oh no, babe

Tell me, what can I say?
What am I gonna do? 
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?

Girl, all I know is every time you're here
I feel the change
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Do whatcha got to do

Darling, I can't get enough of your love babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love babe
Oh no, babe

Girl, if I could only make you see
And make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand
Oh well, babe

How can I explain all the things I feel?
You've given me so much
Girl, you're so unreal
Still I keep loving you
More and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do
Because you blow my mind

I get the same old feelin' every time you're here
I feel the change
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Do whatcha got to do

Darling, I can't get enough of your love babe
Oh no, babe

Baby, let me take all of my life to find you
But you can believe it's gonna take 
the rest of my life to keep you

Oh no, babe
My darling, I can't get enough of your love babe
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love babe
Oh my darling, I can't get enough of your love babe
Oh babe
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love babe
Oh babe
I never take anything for granted
Only a fool maybe takes things for granted
Just because it's here today
It can be gone tomorrow
And that's one thing that you
Never in your life ever have to worry about me
If I'll ever change towards you because
Baby I love you
Yeah I love you
Just the way, You are

Don't go changing, trying to please me
You never let me down before
I don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
I don't want to work that hard
I just want some someone to talk to
I want you just the way you are

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you

I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from my heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are
Is love so fragile
And the heart so hollow
Shatter with words
Impossible to follow
You're saying I'm fragile
I try not to be
I search only
For something
I can't see

I have my own life
And I am stronger
Than you know
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace

You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by

Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace

Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace
Take from me
My lace
Take from me
My lace
I guess this time you're really leaving
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well as my broken heart lies bleeding
you say true love is suicide

You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore

Now I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hiding place
Well I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday

And Baby you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine

I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
Steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what a love can do
I'll be there for you

And I wasn't there when you were happy
I wasn't there when you were down
I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out

I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
Steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what a love can do
I'll be there for you
Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart

I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears

I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart
Bring the beat in!

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a little work)
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you

You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top

Ooh! Come on baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh oooh! Come on babe
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
My love on top
My love on top
Baby Baby

I can hear the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again and again

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a little work)
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top

Oh! Baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Oh Oh! Come on baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
My love on top

Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you baby everything stops
Finally you put my love on top

Baby, you're the one I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you everything stops
Finally you put my love on top

Baby.
'Cause you're the one that I love
Baby you're the one that I need
You're the only man I see
Baby baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I always call
When I need you everything stops
Finally you put my love on top

Baby.
'Cause you're the one that I love
Baby you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I always call
When I need you everything stops
Finally you put my love on top
Swaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one
I see you through the smoky air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all
Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss

Because, I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you
Crazy for you, crazy for you

It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true, I'm crazy, crazy for you
It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true, yeah, I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you, baby
You and I must make a pact, we must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there

I'll reach out my hand to you, I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there

And oh, I'll be there to comfort you,
Build my world of dreams around you, I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on, yes I will, yes I will

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, well that's all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
I'll be there to protect you, with an unselfish love I respect you
Just call my name and I'll be there

And oh, I'll be there to comfort you,
Build my world of dreams around you, I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on, yes I will, yes I will

If you should ever find someone new, I know he'd better be good to you
'Cos if he doesn't, I'll be there

Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there, just call my name, I'll be there

Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh

I'll be there, I'll be there, whenever you need me, I'll be there

Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
Oh when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Oh baby I'm so into you
Darling if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping

It's just a

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
Nothing you can say,
Can tear me away,
From my guy
Nothing you could do,
'cause I'm stuck like glue,
To my guy
I'm sticking to my guy,
Like a stamp to a letter,
Like birds to there feathers,
We, stick together,
I'm tellin you from the start,
I can't be torn apart from my guy

Nothing you could do,
Could make me be untrue,
To my guy.
(My Guy)
Nothing you could buy,
Could make me tell a lie,
To my guy
(My Guy)
I gave my guy,
My word of honor,
To be faithful,
And I'm gonna,
You'd best be believing,
I won't be deceiving,
My guy

As a matter of opinion,
I think he's tops,
My opinion is,
He's the cream of the crop,
As a matter of taste,
To be exact,
He's my ideal,
As a matter of fact.

No muscle bound man,
Could take my hand,
From my guy
(My guy)
No handsome face,
Could ever take the place,
Of my guy,
(My guy)
He may not be a movie star,
But when it comes to being happy,
We are,
There's not a man today,
Who can take me away,
From my guy

No muscle bound man,
Could take my hand,
From my guy
(My guy)
No handsome face,
Could ever take the place,
Of my guy,
(My guy)
He may not be a movie star,
But when it comes to being happy,
We are,
There's not a man today,
Who can take me away,
From my guy
(what'cha say?)

There's not a man today,
Who could take me away,
From my guy.
(Tell me more!)

There's not a man today,
Who could take me away,
From my guy
Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
And think of you
Caught up in circles confusion
Is nothing new
Flashback warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories,
Time after 

Sometimes you picture me 
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I cant hear
What you've said 
Then you say go slow 
I fall behind 
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting 
Time after time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting 
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has 
Turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time 

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting 
Time after time

You said go slow 
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds 

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting 
Time after time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting 
Time after time

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
They can't keep a good man down 
Always keep a smile when they want me to frown
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds 
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse 
Things gettin better when they thought it would be worst
Here comes the officers askin for a search, they found no weopen just only a draw first

Cause I'm so solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
Even when they set their traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now

When they come with they evilest thoughts I just listen whenever they talk
Jah is the light into my dark, he cut and tear on my path
They fight without a cause tryin to make my life so hard
The king of kings and the lord of lords, give it all rewards

I'm so solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
Even when they set their traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now

So don't you mix me up with your dirty games, your only tryin to tarnish my name
Your only lookin for the innocent to blame, when your the ones who issue the guns down the lane
You only cause dysfunction and frame, but the right ones believe in the reign
Love is all I got to give and I'm not ashamed, lookin towards the future this lie can't tame

Cause I'm so solid as a rock and they just can't stop me now
Even when they set their traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now
No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day

No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart,
of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart,
baby of my heart
She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
She s got a way of pleasin'
I don't know what it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason anyway
She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way of talkin'
I don't know why it is
But it lifts me up when we are walkin' anywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound She touches me
and I get turned around
She's got a way of showin'
How I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on goin'
She's got a light around her
And ev'rywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her
everywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around

She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her anyway
Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she doe just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
Ask her if she'll marry me
In some old fashioned way

But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing, every little thing
Every little, every little, every little
Every little thing she does

Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Thing she does is magic

Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing she do is magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic, magic

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet
Girl, I can't let you do this
Let you walk away
Girl, how can I live through this
When you're all I wake up for each day?

Baby, you're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I've got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby, what good am I?

I never had much goin'
But at least I had you
How can you walk out knowin'
I ain't got nothin' left if you do?
Baby, you're my soul and my heart's inspiration

You're all I've got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby, what good am I, oh what good am I?
[Spoken:] Baby, I can't make it withoutcha. And I'm, I'm tellin' ya, honey-you're my
reason for laughin', for cryin', for livin', and for dying

Baby, I can't make it without you
Please, I'm begging you baby
If you go it will kill me
I swear it, Dear, my love can't bear it

You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I've got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby, what good am I, what good am I?
You can dance every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man
Who held your hand 'neath the pale moonlight

But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me, mmm

Oh, I know that the music's fine
Like sparkling wine go and have your fun
Laugh and sing but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone

But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me, mmm

Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you, oh, so much

You can dance, go and carry on
Till the night is gone and it's time to go
If he asks, if you're all alone
Can he take you home, you must tell him, no

Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arm's you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me

Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arm's you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me, mmm

Save the last dance for me,
Save the last dance for me,
Save the last dance for me
o you wanna dance, and hold my hand?
Tell me you're my lover man
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?

We could dance under the moonlight,
hug and kiss all through the night
Oh baby, tell me, do you wanna dance with me baby?

Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance with me baby?

Ah, that's right, ah, ah, aaaaaaaah.
Do you want to dance under the moonlight?
Hug me, kiss me, baby, all through the night
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me, do you want to dance?

Oh, do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you want to dance?

Please dance with me baby
additional lyrics from the quadrophonic version
Tonight you, you got to
dance with me baby.
Please, please, please
dance with me baby
Please, please, please, please
dance with me baby
Please, you got to
I want to live,
I want to give
I've been a miner
for a heart of gold
It's these expressions
I never give
That keep me searching
for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean
for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind,
it's such a fine line
That keeps me searching
for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searching
for a heart of gold
You keep me searching
for a heart of gold
And I'm growing old
I've been a miner
for a heart of gold
Baby, i'm amazed at the way you love me all the time,
and maybe i'm afraid of the way i leave you

maybe i'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time,
you hung me on the line
maybe i'm amazed at the way i really need you

baby, i'm a man, maybe i'm a lonely man
who's in the middle of something
that he doesn't really understand

baby, i'm a man,
and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me
baby, won't you help me to understand?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh

baby, i'm a man, maybe i'm a lonely man
who's in the middle of something
that he doesn't really understand

baby, i'm a man,
and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me.
baby, won't you help me to understand?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

maybe i'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time,
maybe i'm afraid of the way leave you.

maybe i'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song,
right me when i'm wrong
maybe i'm amazed at the way i really need you.
Tonight it's very clear, as we're both standing here,
there's so many things I want to say
I will always love you, I will never leave you alone.

Sometimes I just forget, say things I might regret,
it breaks my heart to see you crying.
I don't want to lose you,
I could never make it alone.

I am a man who would fight for your honor,
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of.
We'll live forever,knowing together 
that we did it all for the glory of love.

You keep me standing tall, you help me through it all,
I'm always strong when you're beside me.
I have always needed you,
I could never make it alone.

I am a man who would fight for your honor,
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of.
We'll live forever,knowing together 
that we did it all for the glory of love.

Just like a knight in shining armor,
from a long time ago.
Just in time I will save the day,
take you to my castle far away.

I am a man who would fight for your honor,
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of.
We'll live forever,knowing together 
that we did it all for the glory of love.

We'll live forever, knowing together 
that we did it all for the glory of love.
Girl, tell me only this
That I have your heart for always
And you want me by your side
Whispering the words I'll always love you

And forever I will be your lover
And I know if you really care
I will always be there

Now I need to tell you this
There's no other love like your love
And I, as long as I live
I'll give you all the joy
My heart and soul can give

Let me hold you
I need to have you near me
And I feel with you in my arms
This love will last forever

Because I'm truly
Truly in love with you girl
I'm truly head over heels with your love
I need you, and with your love I'm free
And truly, you know you're alright with me
I can't help but wait, oh uh
Can't help but wait
Check it out, uh

I see you, you with him
He ain’t right but you don’t trip
You stand by while he lies
Then turn right round and forgive

I can’t take to see your face
With those tears runnin' down your cheeks
But what can I do, I gotta stay true
Because deep down I’m still a G

And I don’t want to come between you and your man
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

Girl I can’t help but wait
Till you get that with him it don’t change
Can’t help but wait
Till you see that with me it ain’t the same

Can’t help but wait
Till you see you for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I can’t help but wait

Listen, it ain't fresh
To just let him call the shots
You’re a queen, you should be
Gettin' all that someone’s got

You should be rockin' the latest in purses
Bracelets and watches you’re worth
Much more than an occasional
I love you, I’m thinking of you

And I don’t wanna come between you and your man, no
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

Girl I can’t help but wait
Till you get that with him it don’t change
Can’t help but wait
Till you see that with me it ain’t the same

Can’t help but wait
Till you see you for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I can’t help but wait

Get it together
You can do better
See is believin'
And I see what you need so

I’m going to play my position
Let you catch what you’ve been missing
I’m calling out, girl cuz

I can’t help but wait
Till you get that with him it don’t change
Can’t help but wait
Till you see that with me it ain’t the same

Can’t help but wait
Till you see you for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I can’t help but wait

Till you get that with him
It don’t change
Can’t help but wait
Till you see that with me it ain’t the same

Can’t help but wait
Till you see you for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I can’t help but wait

Can’t help but wait babe, no no no
I can’t help but wait
Oh oh oh
Can’t help wait
No, no, no

Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me

pleasure is on the other side.
Let down your guard just a little
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine

Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low
And you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love

Running out until we're breathless
Let's be hopeful, don't get broken
Let's stay caught up in the moment

I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low

Give you wild love

Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (oh)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain

And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment you'll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
And if you really need me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
Baby, love me harder
Love me, love me, love me
Harder, harder, harder

I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain

And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I'll make it feel like the first time

'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (Imma love you harder)
And if you really need me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (love me harder)
Love me, love me, love me
Hader, hader, hader
Love me, love me, love me
Harder, harder, harder

So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
You got to try, try, try again, yeah.
So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
I'm gonna leave, leave, leave again

'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (Imma love you, love you, love you)
And if you really need me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (love me, love me, baby)
'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (love me harder)
And if you really need me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder (Imma love you harder)
Love me, love me, love me
Harder, harder, harder
(love me, love me, baby)
Love me, love me, love me
(just a little bit, harder, harder, baby)
Harder, harder, harder
Who's around when the days feel long
Who's around when you can't be strong
Who's around when you're losing your mind
Who cares that you get home safe
Who knows you can't be replaced
Who thinks that you're one of a kind

Somebody misses you when you're away
They wanna wake up with you everyday
Somebody wants to hear you say
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you

I'm around when your head is heavy
I'm around when your hands aren't steady
I'm around when your day's gone all wrong
I care that you feel at home
Cause I know that you feel alone
I think you're going to miss me when I'm gone

Somebody misses you when you're away
They wanna wake up with you everyday
Somebody wants to hear you say
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you

Why don't you come on over
Why don't you lay me down
Does the pain feel better
When I'm around
If I am good to you
Won't you be good to me
That's how easy this should be

Somebody misses you when you're away (Somebody misses you baby)
They wanna wake up with you everyday (They wanna wake up with you)
Somebody wants to hear you say (Oh they want you to say)
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I cant pin you down
Whats going on in that beautiful mind
Im your magical mystery ride
And Im so dizzy, dont know what hit me, but Ill be alright

My heads under water
But Im breathing fine
Youre crazy and Im out of my mind

Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
Ill give my all to you
Youre my end and my beginning
Even when I lose Im winning
Cause I give you all, all of me
And you give me all, all of you

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when youre crying youre beautiful too
The world is beating you down, Im around through every move
Youre my downfall, youre my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I cant stop singing, its ringing, I my head for you

My heads under water
But Im breathing fine
Youre crazy and Im out of my mind

Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
Ill give my all to you
Youre my end and my beginning
Even when I lose Im winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all, all of you

Cards on the table, were both showing hearts
Risking it all, though its hard

Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
Ill give my all to you
Youre my end and my beginning
Even when I lose Im winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
I give you all, all of me
And you give me all, all of you
I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain,
I will never be the same without you, without you

I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by without you, without you
I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I, without you, without you

Oh oh oh
You! You! You!
Without
You! You! You!
Without you

Can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night without you, without you
I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind without you, without you

I am lost, I am vain,
I will never be the same without you, without you
Without you
It's been said and done,
Every beautiful thought's been already sung,
And I guess right now here's another one,
So your melody will play on and on,
With the best of 'em
You are beautiful,
Like a dream come alive, incredible,
A centerfold, miracle, lyrical,
You've saved my life again.
And I want you to know baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat.
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat.
Constantly, boy you played through my mind like a symphony,
There's no way to describe what you do to me,
You just do to me, what you do.
And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free,
I am hypnotized by your destiny.
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful,
You are, and I want you to know baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat.
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat.
(I love you, I love you like a love song).
No one compares,
You stand alone to every record I own.
Music to my heart that's what you are,
A song that goes on and on.
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat.
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I-I love you like a love song, baby
I love you, like a love song
[Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny

But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Luda, When I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compaired to my baby
And nobody came between us
or could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh I was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks
She make my heart pound
and skip a beat when I see her in the street
and, At school, on the playground
But I really wanna see her on the weekend
She know she got me dazing
Cuz she was so amazing
And now, my heart is breakin'
But I just keep on sayin'
Baby, baby, baby ohh

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, ooh
I'm gone
Oh, her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?" I say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are, yeah

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are, yeah
It's complicated, it always is
That's just the way it goes
Feels like I've waited so long for this
I wonder if it shows?

Head under water, now I can breath
It never felt so good
'Cause I can feel it coming over me
I wouldn't stop it if I could

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight

Give me a reason, I gotta know
Do you feel it too?
Can't you see me here on overload?
And this time I blame you

Oh, looking out for you to hold my hand
It feels like I could fall
Now love me right like I know you can
We could lose it all

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

I'll be loving all the time, it's true
'Cause I want to make it right with you

When love takes over, when love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over, when love takes over
When love takes over

When love takes over, when love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over, when love takes over
When love takes over

When love takes over, when love takes over
When love takes over, when love takes over

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years

To make you feel my love.
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong.
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue.

No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret.
Though winds of change are throwing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
Nothing that I wouldn't do.
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love...
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You, you belong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know?
Baby, you belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know?
Baby, you belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
I don't know you
But I want you all the more for that
And words fall through me
And always fool me and I can't react

And games that never amount
To more than they're meant
Will play themselves out

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice
You've made it now

Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I can't go back
Moods that take me and erase me
And I'm painted black

You have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you had a choice
You've made it now

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you had a choice
You've made it now

Falling slowly, sing your melody
I'll sing along
Head under water
And you tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder
Even I know that

Made room for me
It's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breakin' this

If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin'
I'm gonna need a better reason
To write you a love song today
Today

I learned the hard way
That they all say
Things you wanna hear
My heavy heart sinks deep down under

You and your twisted words
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this, too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breakin' this

If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin'
I'm gonna need a better reason
To write you a love song today

Promise me
You'll leave the light on
To help me see
With daylight my guide gone

'Cause I believe
There's a way
You can love me
Because I say

I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song

'Cause you tell me it's make or breakin' this
Is that why you wanted a love song?
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one

You see I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breakin' this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay

If your heart is nowhere in it
I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas
When I believe that there's a reason to write you a love song today
Today
Ridin' in the drop top with the top down
Saw you switchin' lanes girl
Pull up to the red light lookin' right
Come on let me get your name girl

Come on and let me show you round, let me take you out
Betcha we can have some fun girl
'Cause we could dress it up, we could dress it down

Summer's over for the both of us (summer's over)
But that doesn't mean we should give up on love (don't give up)
Your the one that I've been thinkin' of (your the one)
And I knew the day I met you, you'd be the one

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L.O.V.E)

Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L.O.V.E)
This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach
Your's is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
Now I don't know where I am
Don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go
And so I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realized that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home
Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange
You said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said, "This is the first day of my life
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
But, now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy"
So if you wanna be with me
With these things there's no telling
We'll just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery
Besides, maybe this time it's different
I mean I really think you like me, me, me, me
Let me be your hero

Would you dance, if I asked you to dance?
Would you run, and never look back?
Would you cry, if you saw me crying?
And would you save my soul, tonight?

Would you tremble, if I touched your lips?
Would you laugh? Oh please tell me this
Now would you die, for the one you love?
Hold me in your arms, tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

Would you swear, that you'll always be mine?
Or would you lie? Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
I don't care you're here, tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

Oh, I just wanna hold you
I just wanna hold you, oh yeah
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
Well I don't care you're here, tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain, oh yeah
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

I can be your hero, I can kiss away the pain
(I can be your hero, baby)
And I will stand by you, forever
You can take my breath away
You can take my breath away
An' I can be your hero
I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin you darlin'
Makes me so confused
[Répétition 1]:
I keep on
Fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you
[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you
[Répétition 1]
[Bridge]:
Oh baby
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall
[Répétition 1]
[Répétition 2] x2:
I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you
What?
I keep on fallin'
When the visions around you
bring tears to your eyes
And all that surround you
are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength
i'll give you hope
keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call
was standing here all along...
And i will take
you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Till the day my life is through
This i promise you
This i promise you...
I've loved you forever
in lifetimes before
And i promise you never
will you hurt anymore
I give you my word
I give you my heart
This is a battle we've won
and with this vow
forever has now begun...
Just close your eyes
each loving day
I know this feeling won't go away, no
Till the day my life is through
This i promise you
This i promise you...
Over and over i fall
When i hear you call
Without you in my life, baby
I just wouldn't be living at all...
And i will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Till the day my life is through
This i promise you
Just close your eyes
Each loving day
I know this feeling won't go away, no
Every word i say is true, this i promise you This i promise you
You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that

I'll tell you you're right when you want
And if only you could see into me

Oh when you're cold, I'll be there
Hold you tight to me

When you're on the outside baby and you can't get in
I will show you, you're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone and you cant get back again
I will find you darling and I will bring you home

And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time, you'll be fine

You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think id leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that

I'll tell you you're right when you want
And if only you could see into me

Oh when you're cold, I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh when you're low
I'll be there by your side baby

Oh when you're cold, I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh when you're low
I'll be there by your side baby
Baby I've been drifting away and dreaming all day
Of holding you, touching you
The only thing I want to do is be with you
As close to you as I can be

Let's make love all night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight just let go
I wanna feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up, let's make love, oh, baby

Do you know what you do to me, everything inside of me
Is wanting you and needing you
I'm so in love with you, look in my eyes
Let's get lost tonight in each other

Let's make love all night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight just let go
I wanna feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up, let's make love

Let's make love all night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight just let go
I wanna feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Oh, until the sun comes up, let's make love

Oh baby, let's make love
All night long
Let's make love
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there,
They'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad

And I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
And oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door,
I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

And I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
And oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life
And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
'Cause sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
Ev'ry night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance and spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door and you're
Here in my heart and my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time and last for a
Lifetime and never let go till we're gone
Love, was when I loved you, one true time
I had to, in my life we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door and you're
Here in my heart and my heart will go on and on

You're here, there's nothing I fear, and I know
That my heart will go on. We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart and my heart will go on
And on
How do I get through one night without you?
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be?

Oh, I, I need you in my arms, need you to hold
You're my world, my heart, my soul and if you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything good in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

Without you there'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me

And I, baby, I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you, if you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything real in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

Please, tell me, baby
How do I go on if you ever leave?
Baby, you would take away everything, I need you with me
Baby, don't you know that you're everything good in my life?
And tell me now

How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

How do I live without you?
How do I live without you, baby?
How do I live?
You come out in night
That's when the energy comes
And the dark side's light
And the vampires roam
Struts your rasta wear
And your suicide poem
And a cross from a faith
That died before Jesus came
You're building a mystery

You live in a church
Where you sleep with voodoo dolls
And you won't give up the search
For the ghosts in the halls
Wear sandals in snow and
A smile that won't wash away
Can you look at the window
Without your shadow getting in the way

(Ooh)
You're so beautiful
With an edge and a charm
You're so careful
When I'm in your arms

'Cause you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on, holding it in
Oh yeah, you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully

You woke up screaming aloud
A prayer from your secret God
To feed off our fears
And hold back your tears
Oh you give us a tantrum
And a know-it-all grin
Just when we need one
When the evening's thin

Oh you're so beautiful
A beautiful fucked up man
You're setting up your
Razor wire shrine

'Cause you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on, holding it in
Oh yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully

Ooh you're working
You're building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in
Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully

Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in
Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully
You're building a mystery
For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right

For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful, baby
You're the one who held me up, never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach

You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

Secret Garden
She'll let you in her house
If you come knockin' late at night
She'll let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right
If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides

She'll let you in her car
To go drivin' round
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That'll bring you down
She'll let you in her heart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden, don't think twice

You've gone a million miles
How far'd you get
To that place where you can't remember
And you can't forget

She'll lead you down a path
There'll be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
She'll look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
She's got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
A million miles away
You and me
We used to be together
Every day together always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end
It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real
Well I don't want to know
Don't speak

I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories

They can be inviting
But some are altogether mighty frightening
As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands I sit and cry
Don't speak

I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
(no, no, no) Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

It's all ending
I gotta stop pretending who we are
You and me

I can see us dying ... are we?
Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

(No, no) Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
I know what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't speak
Don't speak
Don't speak (no)
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
I know you're good
I know you're good
I know your real good
Don't, don't
Hush, hush, darling
Don't tell 'cause hurts
Hush, hush, darling
Watch Now
I'll Stand By You
I'll Stand By You
Oh, why gotta' you look so sad?
Tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don't be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
'Cause I've seen the dark side too
When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothin' you confess, could make me love you less
I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
So, if you're mad, get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey, what you got to hide?
I get angry too
Well I'm a lot like you
When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
'Cause even if you're wrong
I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
And when, when the night falls on you, baby
You're feelin' all alone
You won't be on your own
I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you

Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face-to-face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

la da da da - da da.-

Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see
Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last
You went and saved the best for last
Yeah...
look into my eyes you will see what you mean to me
search your heart search your soul and when you find me there you'll search no more
dont tell me it's not worth trying for
can't tell me it's not worth dying for
you know it's true every thing i do i do it for you
look into your heart you will find there's nothing there to hide
take me as i am take my life
i would give it all i would sacrifice don't tell me it's not worth fighting for i can't help it there's nothing i want more

Everything I do girl
And we'll see it through
Oh we'll see it through
Oh yeah
Yeah
You can't tell me it's not worth dying for
Oh yeah
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since u took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said girl you better have fun
No matter what you do
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted, mama
In the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but, if you only knew
How easy, it would be to show me how you feel
More than words, is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say, that you love me
Cos I'd already know

What would you do, if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say, if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you

More than words...

Now that I've tried to, talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands, and touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go
More than words, is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say, that you love me
Cos I'd already know
More than words...
More than words...
The world was on fire and no-one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
With you

What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you

And I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you

The world was on fire, no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I...
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
(This world is only gonna break your heart)

Nobody loves no one
When I look in your eyes
There I see
Just what you mean to me

Here in my heart I believe
Your love is all I'll ever need
Holdin' you close through the night
I need you, yeah

I look in your eyes and there I see
What happiness really means
The love that we share makes life so sweet
Together we'll always be

Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart

I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears

I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart

I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

You were standing
I was there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating? Do you understand?
Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?

I believe it's meant to be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping, you belong with me
Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning an eternal flame?

Say my name, sun shines through the rain
A whole life, so lonely
Then come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling

Say my name, sun shines through the rain
A whole life, so lonely
Then come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling

Close your eyes, give me your hand
Do you feel my heart beating? Do you understand?
Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning an eternal flame?

Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating? Do you understand?
Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?

Close your eyes, give me your hand
Do you feel my heart beating? Do you understand?
Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?
An eternal flame?

Close your eyes, give me your hand
Do you feel my heart beating? Do you understand?
Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you

Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live, with or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

My hands are tied
My body bruised, she got me with
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live, with or without you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live, with or without you
With or without you
Yeah ye ye yeah yeah

Sting, Bad Boy remix come on
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Hey yo shake what ya mama gave you is her motto
Pour out the bottle, blow out the candle
Too broke to hold, too shallow to handle
Get all today you never promised tomorrow

Yeah, her moves remind me of Kung Fu flicks
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Thick lips that contradicts
Rules of the game, she plays the politics
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Red light special, red light district

Put on ya make up body all made up
Platinum played up, Pearl Jam cut up
Roxanne, Roxanne you don't really have to
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Put on ya red dress if you feeling kind of blue

She got the hots for the disco jocks
Rock ya socks at the pop of the tops
Never get cool like to call it Glock
Twisted minded like Bob Zealot

Roxanne
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

Yo what's the haps girl, dancing for the green paperback
Sitting at the bar drinking up Cognac
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
She steps in the room, don't know how to act
Sweet in emergence, similar to Similac

It was the hat, cats wanna be around her shine
She wants to party, have a good time
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
She feels kind of hot me feelin', feelin' fine
Diggin' all her life just to get a gold mine
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Bro making the streets, she's the pimper's paradise
Jewels around her neck getting strong with the ice
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
She said I heard of ya crew I'm the number one fan
Of the refugees down from the islands

Driving the Bentleys with her pretty pretty friends
Sippin' colada every day is a weekend
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Heard your name was Pras outta Brooklyn
And fifteen million place with your total sound scan

I loved you since I knew you
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
I wouldn't talk down to you
I have you to tell just how I feel
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
I won't share you with another boy

I know my mind is made up
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
So put away your makeup
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Told you once I won't tell you again
It's a bad way

Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
You don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Put on the red light
I wanna be your man
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life, I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no names
Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn
'Coz I said to myself look what you've done to her
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal

Playing make believe pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amor, kissing you on the ear
Whispering I love you and I'll always be here
Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
And half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy

I need love
I need love

Romance sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say ooo girl you're so sweet
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever telling you what I do

But where you at you're neither here or there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen
Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean
Fantasy's can run but they can't hide
And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside

I need love
I need love

I wanna kiss you, hold you never scold you just love you
Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice, I need love bad
I've got money but love's something I've never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's ten feet tall

I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream land, I can't lie I never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something I'll never forget

I need love
I need love

See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer
A play boy on the run I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust honor respect admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It's taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you you're my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over from the slightest touch of your hand

And understand I'll be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you girl I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally find you watch our love unfurl

I need love
I need love

Girl, listen to me
When I be sittin' in my room all alone, staring at the wall
Fantasies, they go through my mind
And I've come to realize that I need true love
And if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen
I'll be waiting, I love you
Swaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one
I see you through the smoky air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all
Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss

Because, I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you
Crazy for you, crazy for you

It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true, I'm crazy, crazy for you
It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true, yeah, I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you, baby
Girl you are to me
All that a woman should be
And I dedicate my life to you
Always

A love like yours is rare
It must have been sent from up above
And I know you'll stay this way
For always

And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever, it will be
You and me hey

Oh, you're like the sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me, and you forever will be
And I will love you so
For always

Come with me my sweet
Let's go make a family
And they will bring us joy
For always

Oh boy I love you so
I can't find enough ways to let you know
But you can be sure I'm yours
For always

And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever, it will be
You and me hey

Oh, you're like the sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me, and you forever will be
And I will love you so
For always

Hey oh, you're like the sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me, and you forever will be
And I will love you so
For always

Oh oh I will love you so
For always
Yesterday
I knew the games to play
I thought I knew the way
Life was meant to be
But now there's you
My foolish games are through
Now at least I have found
Just what makes this whole world turn around

Love is all I have to give
Love is all, as long as I shall live
So take it all
And I'll always be there when you call my name
I know now that love is all

Every night
I long to hold you tight
Until the mornin' light
Shines in your eyes,
So love me now
We'll get along somehow
Won't you please take my hand
And together, forever, we'll stay

Love is all I have to give
Love is all, as long as I shall live
So take it all
And I'll always be there when you call my name
I know now that love is all
I hear the tickin' of the clock
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh I hope that it won't end though
Alone

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was going to tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

Ohh
Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
Alone, alone

The Best Of Love
Stop To Love
Lately love keeps keeping up at night
Tossing and turning, my love
Wanna kiss you, wanna hold you real tight
Ooo but I wonder love whether you know or not
You just hurry away, leaving me laying there in shock

I just wanna be the one that you wanna see
I just wanna have you near me
But you fly away almost everyday
You work a lot but you never stop to love

[CHORUS:]
Stop, I love you so stop
Come home from the road
Gotta stop to love
And let's celebrate, celebrate the love we got, stop
Say you're coming home

You say my love has always been on your mind
But how can I ever love you, when you keep working overtime?
Too many empty nights, can make almost any guy roam
to look for the love he don't get whenever he's at home alone.

Awaiting the day that you're coming to stay
I hate to see you go away, but you couldn't rest
Had to do your best to reach the top
But you did not stop to love

[REPEAT CHORUS]

And one day you'll discover I'm the one who love ya
Gotta stop to love
No one loves you better
Can't you stay forever?
Stop to love
I can hardly stand the loneliness
Come on home, that's what it's all about
You really turn me out

[REPEAT CHORUS]
"It Must Have Been Love"

Lay a whisper on my pillow,
leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely,
there's air of silence in the bedroom
and all around
Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winters day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It's all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying

And you, don't you know my tears will burn the pillow?
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you
Oh you, all over you

Never wanted to see things your way
I had to go astray, oh why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home, how could I be so wrong?

Leaving me all alone
Don't you know the hurt will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame?
You were the one who left me neglected, I'm so sorry

Apology not accepted
At me to the broken hearts you've collected

I, I gave you all of me, gave you all of me
How was I to know you would weaken so easily?
I, I don't know what to do
Now I'm all cried out, I'm all, over you, I'm cried out too

I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, I left me so confused
Now I'm all cried out, now I'm all cried out over you
We belong
We belong to the light

Many times I tried to tell you
Many times you cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well
You cut my feelings to the bone

Don't wanna leave you really
I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind

We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under

Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together

Maybe, it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe, I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway

Have we become a habit?
Do we distort the facts?
Now, there's no looking forward
Now, there's no turning back

When you say
We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under

Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together

Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best to try
And wash the palette clean

We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere

Still you say
We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under

Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together

We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under

Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together

We belong to the light

I Want To Know What Love Is
I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
I through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
And I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is
And I know, I know you can show me

Let's talk about love
I wanna know what love is, the love that you feel inside
I want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love
I wanna feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide
I know you can show me, yeah

I wanna know what love is, let's talk about love
I want you to show me, I wanna feel it too
I wanna feel what love is, I want to feel it too
And I know and I know, I know you can show me
Show me love is real, yeah
I wanna know what love is...
What's Love Got To Do With It (The Voice Performance)-Ryan Whyte Maloney
You must understand
That the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that
Oh what's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart
When a heart can be broken
It may seem to you
That I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason
You do it for me
Oh what's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart
When a heart can be broken
I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
Oh what's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart
When a heart can be broken
What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in the circles
Confusion is nothing new

Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories, time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said

Then you say "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay

Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time

Time can never mend the careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance's is kind
There's no comfort in the truth pain is the hole you'll find
Should've known better yeah
Whoa oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Umm-hmm

I feel so unsure as I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies something in your eyes calls to mind the silver screen and all its sad goodbyes
I'm never gonna dance again guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
Waste the chance that I'd been given

So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with y-o-u...
Oh-oh-oh
Time can never mend the careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance's is kind
There's no comfort in the truth pain is the hole you'll find
I'm never gonna dance again guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool
Should've known

(should've known better yeah) better than to cheat a friend
Waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you oh...
Never without your love
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd

Maybe it's better this way we'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay
And I'm never gonna dance again guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend

Waste the chance that I'd been given

So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with y-o-u...
Oh-oh
Now that you're gone...
Now... that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Was what I did so wrong?
So wrong that you had to leave me alone
Moving forward using all my breath
Making love to you was never second best
I saw the world crashing all around your face
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace

I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you

(You should know better)
Dream of better lives the kind which never hates
(You should see why)
Trapped in the state of imaginary grace
(You should know better)
I made a pilgrimage to save this humans race
(You should see why)
Never comprehending the race has long gone bye

(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world) You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
(Let's stop the world) There's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you

The future's open wide

The future's open wide

Highway run into the midnight sun
Wheels go 'round and 'round, you're on my mind
Restless hearts sleep alone tonight
Sendin' all my love along the wire

They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line it's been you and me
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh, girl you stand by me, I'm forever yours, faithfully

Circus life under the big top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile
Through space and time, always another show
Wondering where I am lost without you

And bein' apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh girl, you stand by me, I'm forever yours, faithfully

Faithfully, I'm still yours
I'm forever yours, ever yours
Faithfully
Lying beside you.
Here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat
With mine
Softly you whisper
You're so sincere
How could our love
Be so blind

We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms

Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
And maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
I am so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind (you were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind (you were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind
For the other half of the sky

Woman I can hardly express
My mixed emotions at my thoughtlessness
After all, I'm forever in your debt
And woman I will try to express
My inner feelings and thankfulness
For showing me the meaning of success

Ooh, well well
Doo doo doo, doo doo
Ooh, well well
Doo doo doo, doo doo

Woman I know you understand
The little child inside the man
Please remember my life is in your hands
And woman hold me close to your heart
However distant don't keep us apart
After all it is written in the stars

Ooh, well well
Doo doo doo, doo doo
Ooh, well well
Doo doo doo, doo doo
Well

Woman please let me explain
I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain
So let me tell you again and again and again

I love you, yeah yeah
Now and forever
I love you, yeah yeah
Now and forever

I love you, yeah yeah
Now and forever
I love you, yeah yeah
Now and forever
Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she doe just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
Ask her if she'll marry me
In some old fashioned way

But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Every little, every little, every little, every little
Every little thing she does is magic
Every little thing she does is magic

Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my live before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on and on.
My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's bright

My first love
You're every breath that I take

You're every step I make
And I
I

I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do

And your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes
They tell me how much you care

Oh yes, you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
Forever
Oh

I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
And love
Oh, love
I'll be a fool

For you I'm sure
You know I don't mind

Oh, you know I don't mind
'Cause you, you mean the world to me, oh
I know
I know
I've found in you
My endless love
Boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Oh, and love
Oh, love
I'll be that fool for you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh you know
I don't mind
And, yes, you'll be the only one
'Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love
My love, my love
My endless love
Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger an endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower and you, it's only seed

It's the heart, afraid of breaking that never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking that never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dying that never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love, in the spring becomes the rose
(Duet with Brabra Streisand)
Written by: Neil Diamond, Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman

You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come thru the door
At the end of the day

I remember when
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin' me late at night
When it's good for you
And you're feelin' alright
Well you just roll over
And turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore

It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
But "used to be's" don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor
'Til we sweep them away

And baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well I leared how to love
And I learned how to lie
Well you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
And you don't bring me flowers anymore

Well you'd think I could learn
How to tell you 'goodbye'
You don't say you need me
You don't sing me love songs
You don't bring me flowers anymore
It's late in the evening
She's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
And brushes her long blonde hair

And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"

We go to a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
That's walking around with me

And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"

I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys
She helps me to bed

And then I tell her as I turn out the light
I say, "My darling, you are wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you are wonderful tonight"
Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud

You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
I love you

When we are together, the moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you, to hold you, to feel you, to need you
There's nothing to keep us apart

You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
I love you
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall

And you may not think, I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I get high when I see you go by, my oh my
...
When you sigh my inside just flies, butterflies
...
why am I so shy when I'm beside you
...
It's only love and that is all

Why should I feel the way I do
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
...
Is it right that you and I should fight, every night

...
just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, very bright
...
haven't I the right to make up girl

...
It's only love and that is all
...
Why should I feel the way I do
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you
Loving you
...
For so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you is more than strong , girl
Take it from me If you give a little more than you're asking for your love will turn the key
Darling mine I would wait forever for those lips of wine
Build my world around you , darling
This love will shine girl
Watch it and see
If you give a little more than you're asking for your love will turn the key

I , I just want to be your ev'rything
Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me and not some puppet on a string
Oh , if I stay here without you , darling ,I will die
I want you laying in the love I have to bring
I'd do anything to be your ev'rything

Darling for so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you is more than strong girl
Take it from me If you give a little more than you're asking for your love will turn the key

I , I just want to be your ev'rything
Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me and not some puppet on a string
Oh, if I stay here without you , darling , I will die
I want you laying in the love I have to bring
I'd do anything to be your ev'rything

Darling for so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you is more than strong girl
Take it from me If you give a little more than you're asking for your love will turn the key
Oh, it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl
And with the way you look I understand
That you were not impressed
But I heard you let that little friend of mine take off your party dress

I'm not going to get too sentimental
Like those other sticky valentines
'Cause I don't know if you are loving somebody
I only know it isn't mine

Alison, I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison, my aim is true

Well, I see you've got a husband now
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake?
You used to hold him right in your hand
I'll bet he took all he could take

Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking
When I hear the silly things that you say
I think somebody better put out the big light
'Cause I can't stand to see you this way

Alison, I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison, my aim is true
My aim is true

Feelings, nothing more than feelings,
Trying to forget my feelings of love.
Teardrops rolling down on my face,
Trying to forget my feelings of love.

Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it.
I wish I've never met you, girl;
You'll Never Come Again.

Feelings, wo-o-o feelings,
Wo-o-o, feel you again in my arms.

Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
And feelings like i've never have you
Again in my heart.

Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it.
I wish I've never met you, girl;
You'll never come again.

Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
And feelings like i've never have you
Again in my life.

Feelings, wo-o-o feelings,
Wo-o-o, feelings again in my arms.

Feelings...
Whatever gets you thru the night, it's alright, it's alright
It's your money or your life, it's alright, it's alright
Don't need a sword to cut through flower, oh no, oh no

Whatever gets you thru your life, it's alright, it's alright
Do it wrong or do it right, it's alright, it's alright
Don't need a watch to waste your time, oh no, oh no

Hold me, darlin', come on listen to me
I won't do you no harm
Trust me darlin', come on listen to me
Come on listen to me, come on listen to me

Whatever gets you thru the light, it's alright, it's alright
Out've blue or out've sight, alright, alright
Don't need a gun to blow your mind, oh no, oh no

Hold me, darlin', come on listen to me
I won't do you no harm
Trust me darlin', come on listen to me
Come on listen to me, come on listen listen
(Dolly Parton)
Dolly Parton & Vince Gill

If I should stay I would only be in your way
So I'll go but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way
And I will always love you, I will always love you.

Bitter-sweet memories that is all I am taking with me
Goodbye please don't you cry
Cause we both know that I'm not what you need
But I will always love you, I will always love you.

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope that you have all you've dreamed of
I wish you joy and I wish you happiness
But above all of this I wish you love
Oh, oh, and I will always love you, I will always love you.

Yes, I will always love you, I will always love you...
Maybe I hang around here
A little more than I should
We both know
I've got somewhere else to go
but I got something to tell you
that I never thought I would
but I believe you
Really ought to know

I love you,
I honestly love you

You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid
but this is pure and simple
And you must realize
That it's coming from my heart
And not my head

I love you,
I honestly love you

I'm not trying to
Make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to
Make you anything at all
But this feeling
Doesn't come along every day
And you shouldn't
Blow the chance
When you got the chance to say

I love you, I love you
I honestly love you

If we both were born
In another place and time
This moment
Might be ending in a kiss
But there you are with yours
And here I am with mine
So I guess we'll just be
Leaving it like this

I love you,
I honestly love you
I honestly love you

Best Of My Love
The Eagles

Every night
I'm lyin in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinkin about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams
We tried to talk it over
But all the words came out to rough
I know you were tryin
To give me the best of your love
Beautiful faces
And loud empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wastin our time
On cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love
Oh oh oh oh Sweet darlin
You get the best of my love
Oh oh oh oh Sweet darlin
You get the best of my love
I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be alright
If I could go on sleeping
But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it my way
But we both see it slippin away
You know we always
Had each other baby
I guess that was'nt enough
Oh but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love
Oh oh oh oh Sweet darlin
You get the best of my love
Oh oh oh oh Sweet darlin
You get the best of my love
Oh oh oh oh Sweet darlin
You get the best of my love
Oh oh oh oh Sweet darlin
You get the best of my love
Oh oh oh oh oh
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around,
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart

I feel like this is the beginning,
Though I've loved you for a million years,
And if I thought our love was ending,
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears

You are the sunshine of my life,
That's why I'll always stay around,
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart

You must have known that I was lonely,
Because you came to my rescue,
And I know that this must be heaven,
How could so much love be inside of you?

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah,
That's why I'll always stay around,
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart

(Love has joined us,
Love has joined us,
Let's think sweet love)
I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Then, c'mon, oh, c'mon

Let's get it on
Ah, baby, let's get it on
Let's love, baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on

We're all sensitive people
With so much to give
Understand me, sugar
Since we've got to be here
Let's live
I love you

There's nothing wrong with me
Loving you, baby no no
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true

Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be
I'm asking you baby to get it on with me
I ain't gonna worry
I ain't gonna push, won't push you baby
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby
Stop beatin' 'round the bush

You don't have to worry that it's wrong
If the spirit moves ya
Let me groove ya good
Let your love come down
Oh, get it on
C'mon, baby
Do you know the meaning?
I've been sanctified
Girl, you give me good feeling
I've been sanctified
I'm... I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is all right with me...
'Cause you... make me feel so brand new...
And I... want to spend my life with you...

Let me say that since, baby
Since we've been together
Ooo...
Loving you forever
Is what I... need...
Let me... be the one you come running to...
I'll... never be untrue...

Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Ooooo... Oooo... Yeah...
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why, somebody, why people break-up
Ohhh, turn around and make-up

You'd... never do that to me... (would you, baby?)
Stayin' around you is all I see

(Here's what I want us to do)

Let's, we oughta stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad... Come on
Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless skies, my love
To the dark and the endless skies

And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command, my love

And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time, my love
And it will last till the end of time, my love

The first time ever I saw your face, your face
Your face, your face
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
But I'm, I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I, I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor but, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling shows
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

So you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
We do not have the lyrics for Superstar (Karaoke Version) [In the Style of the Carpenters] yet.
She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasin'
I don't know what it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason anyway
She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way of talkin'
I don't know why it is
But it lifts me up when we are walkin' anywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
She's got a way of showin'
How I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on goin'

She's got a light around her
And ev'rywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her ev'rywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around

She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is,
But I know that I can't live without her anyway
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people
Living for today, aah haa

Imagine there's no county
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too

Imagine all the people
Living life in peace, you ooh

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world, you ooh

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Maybe I'm amazed at the the way you pulled me out of time
And hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

Maybe I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand

Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby won't you help me understand

Maybe I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand

Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby won't you help me understand

Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song
Right me when I'm wrong
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there

(I'll be there)
I'll reach out my hand to you

I'll have faith in all you do

Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)
And oh, I'll be there to comfort you

(I'll be there)
Build my world of dreams around you

I'm so glad that I found you
(I'll be there)
I'll be there with a love that's strong

I'll be your strength, I'll keep holdin' on
(Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on)
Yes, I'll be
Yes, I'll be
Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, well that's all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
I'll be there to protect you
(Yea, baby)
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)
And oh, I'll be there to comfort you
(I'll be there)
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
(I'll be there)
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holdin' on, huu huu
(Holdin' on)
Yes, I'll be
(Holdin' on)
Yes, I'll be
(Holdin' on)
If you should ever find someone new
I know he'd better be good to you
'Cause if he doesn't, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
Don't you know, baby, yeah, yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
(Just look over your shoulders, honey, uhh)
I'll be there, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
(La la la la la la la)
I'll be there
(La la la la la la la)
I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there

Oo, oo, oo, oo

Let me tell you now

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance
To show you that i love you
Won't you please let me

Back in your heart
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go

But now since I see you in his arms
Yes I do now [(I want you back)]
Ooh, ooh baby [(I want you back)]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [(I want you back)]

Na na na na
Trying to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl

That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around

Let me tell you now
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
To show you that i love you

Won't you please let me
Back in your heart

Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms, uh huh
A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need
A buh buh buh buh
All I want

A buh buh buh buh
All I need
Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby (baby), baby (baby), baby (baby)
Forget what happened then
And let me live again
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
Spare me of this cause
Gimme back what I lost
Oh baby, I need one more chance, ha
I tell ya that I love you
Baby, uh, baby, uh, baby, uh
Hold it, everybody
Hold it, hold it, listen

I can turn the gray sky blue
I can make it rain whenever I want it to
Oh, I can build a castle from a single grain of sand
I can make a ship sail, huh, on dry land

But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue
'Cause I can't get next to you

Next to you
I just can't get next you

I can fly like a bird in the sky
Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy
Oh, I can turn a river into a raging fire
I can live forever if I so desire

Unimportant are all the things I can do
'Cause I can't get next to you

No matter what I do
Uh-yah

Ooh
Ooh
Chicka boom, chicka boom
Chicka boom, boom, boom

I can turn back the hands of time
You better believe I can
I can make the seasons change just by waving my hand
Oh, I can change anything from old to new
The things I want to do the most, I'm unable to do

Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
'Cause girl you're the key to my happiness
And I can't get next to you

Girl, you're blowing my mind
'Cause I can't get [(next to you)]
Can't you see these tears I'm crying?
I can't get [(next to you)]
Girl, it's you that I need
I gotta get [(next to you)]
Can't you see these tears I'm crying?
I can't get [(next to you)]
I, I, I, I
I can't get [(next to you)]
I, I, I, I
I can't get [(next to you)]

Tenement slum
Ooh, ooh, ooh....aaaahhh

You think that I don't feel love
What I feel for you is real love
In other's eyes I see reflected
A hurt, scorned, rejected

Love child
Never meant to be
Love Child
Born in poverty
Love Child
Never meant to be
Love Child
Take a look at me

Started my life
In a old, cold, run-down tenement slum (tenement slum)
My father left he never even married mama
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

This love we're contemplatin'
Is worth the pain of waitin'
We'll only end up hatin'
The child we may be creatin'

Love Child
Never meant to be
Love Child
(Scorned by) Society
Love Child
Always second best
Love Child
(Different from) Different from the rest

(Hold on hold on just a little bit longer) Mmmmm baby
(Hold on hold on just a little bit longer) Mmmmm baby

I started school
In a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out
(Somebody threw out)
I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me

Don't think that I don't need ya
Don't think I don't want to please ya
But no child of mine will be bearing
The name of shame I've been wearing

Love Child
Love Child
Never quite as good
Afraid, ashamed
Misunderstood

But I'll always love you
Always love you

I'll always love you
Always love you
Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know I will
I will
I bet you're wondering how I knew
'bout you're plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys you know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine?
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

Heard it through the grapevine?
Not much longer would you be mine, baby

I know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else

Instead, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, well

Heard it through the grapevine?
Not much longer would you be mine, baby

People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear
But I can't help bein' confused
If it's true, please tell me, dear?
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine?
Not much longer would you be mine
Baby, I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

Heard it through the grapevine?
Not much longer would you be mine, baby

Honey, honey, I know
That you're letting me go
I said I heard through the grapevine
Ooh heard it through the grapevine
Those schoolgirl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To Sir, with love

The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love
We do not have the lyrics for My Ding-A-Ling yet.
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and I rise wipe the sleep out of my eyes
The shavin' razor's cold, and it stings

Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen?

You once thought of me as a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, and our good times start and end without dollar one to spend
But how much baby do we really need?

Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen?
Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen?

Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen?
Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen?

Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen?

I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Ah, love was out to get to me
That's the way it seems
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

{Refrain}
Then i saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer i couldnt leave her if i try

I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
Seemed the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in trying
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

{Refrain}

Ah, love was out to get to me
Now, that's the way it semed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then i saw her face
Now I'm a believer

Oh my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
As time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love
To me
Lonely rivers flow
To the sea
To the sea
To the open arms
Of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
"Wait for me, wait for me"
I'll be coming home
Wait for me.
Oh my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And I know that time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love
To me
To….
Ooooooooooh.
If you let me take your heart
I will prove to you
We will never be apart
If I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me

Big and black the clouds may be
Time will pass away
If you put your trust in me
I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now
Tell me what you see
Don't you realise now?
What you see is me

Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time
How can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm
Tryin' to get to you?
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me

Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time
How can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm

written by Sonny Bono

(Number 1 on Billboard chart for 3 weeks, August 1965)

HER: They say we're young and we don't know
We won't find out until we grow
HIM: Well I don't know if all that's true
'Cause you got me, and baby I got you

HIM: Babe
BOTH: I got you babe
I got you babe

HER: They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent
HIM: I guess that's so, we don't have a pot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

HIM: Babe
BOTH: I got you babe
I got you babe

HIM: I got flowers in the spring
I got you to wear my ring
HER: And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And if I get scared, you're always around

HER: Don't let them say your hair's too long
'Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
HIM: Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

HIM: Babe
BOTH: I got you babe
I got you babe

HIM: I got you to hold my hand
HER: I got you to understand
HIM: I got you to walk with me
HER: I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so

Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

This boy, this boy, this boy

Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you

Treasure these few words 'till we're together
Keep all my love forever

If I fell in love with you
would you promise to be true
and help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
and I found that love was more
than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you,
I must be sure
from the very start
that you,
would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please,

don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
don't hurt my pride like her,
'cause I couldn't stand the pain
and I,
would be sad if our new love,
was in vain
So I hope you see that I,

would love to love you,
and that she will cry
when she learns we are two.
If I fell in love with you
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her

She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Through the mist of a memory you wander back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh
In the still of the night once again I hold you tight
Though you're gone, your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat, lover we'll always meet

Twist

Ahh, we're back

Come on, baby
Let's do the Twist
Come on, baby
Let's do the Twist

Take me by my little hand
And go like this

The party was packed
I'm talking back to back
There was a rapper that was rapping
To a beat that was wack

They was going through the motions
Out on the dance floor
And when the rapper was done
They wasn't yelling encore

The people were tired
Of the same old groove
They wanted something def
Something new and improved

Something easy to do
But hard to resist
I got something for y'all
What do you call it
The Twist

Come on, baby
Let's do the twist
Chubby Checker
And The Fat Boys
We're doing the Twist

Take us by our little hand
And go like this

We, we, we broke into the booth
And the record stacks
Came up with the Twist
And we were scratching the track

People started jamming hard
To the funky sound
Did the Twist down and up
Then up and down

Then I heard somebody yell
Yo, Chubby's here
The people took a little pause
Just to stop and stare

He said, I'll show you people
How to Twist with style
Cause I've been doing The Twist
For a long, long while

Oh, you should see
Prince Markie Dee
Check out that Kool Rock
He's rocking like me

Here comes B-Beat Box
Come on, do it, Buffy

Come on, baby
Come, come, come
Come, come on, baby

Do, do, do, do the Twist
Do, do, do, do the Twist

Come on, baby
Let's do the twist
Chub and the Fat Boys
We're doing the Twist

Take the world by the hand
And do the Twist

Chubby took my sister
Down to the dance floor
Did the Twist so def
The crowd yelled for more

So I Ponyed with my mother
Did the Fly with my goil
And when Buff did the Limbo
We was rocking the world

Come on, baby
Let's do the twist
Chubby Checkers
And The Fat Boys
We're doing the Twist

Take the world by the hand
And go like this

Hey, the West coast
And on the East coast
And in the South

Words by Robert Mellin

Peaked at # 73 in 1962
This is a vocal cover of the instrumental by Mr. Acker Bilk's #1 two months earlier.
Andy Williams also covered it at the same time to # 38.
It was used as the title tune of a British TV show.

Here I stand, watching the tide go out
So all alone and blue
Just dreaming dreams of you

I watched your ship as it sailed out to sea
Taking all my dreams
And taking all of me

The sighing of the waves
The wailing of the wind
The tears in my eyes burn
Pleading, "My love, return"

Why, oh, why must I go on like this?
Shall I just be a lonely stranger on the shore?

The sighing of the waves
The wailing of the wind
The tears in my eyes burn
Pleading, "My love, return"

Why, oh, why must I go on like this?
Shall I just be a lonely stranger on the shore?
Da da da da
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
To be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
The path that I'm walking
I must go alone
I must take the baby steps till I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend, and you'll be mine
Valentine
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers, and share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late and dark outside
I need to be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
La da da da da da
. Surrender
.Elvis Presley(貓王)

When we kiss my heart's on fire
Burning with a strange desire
And I know, each time I kiss you
That your heart's on fire too

So, my darling, please surrender
All your love so warm and tender
Let me hold you in my arms, dear
While the moon shines bright above

All the stars will tell the story
Of our love and all its glory
Let us take this night of magic
And make it a night of love

Won't you please surrender to me
Your lips, your arms, your heart, dear
Be mine forever
Be mine tonight

.Elvis Presley(貓王)
You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake-a sugar but you'll never shake me
No-sir-ee

I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick because I'm stuck on you

I'm gonna run my fingers through your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Yes-sir-ee

I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm stuck on you

Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch ya and the kissin' starts
A team o' wild horses couldn't tear us apart

Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Oh, yeah

I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm stuck on you

Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch ya and the kissin' starts
A team o' wild horses couldn't tear us apart

Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Oh yeah, yes-sir-ee

I'm gonna stick like glue
Yeah yeah, because I'm stuck on you

I'm gonna stick like glue
Yeah yeah, because I'm stuck on you

I'm gonna stick like glue
Yeah yeah
It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
My love won't wait.

When I first saw you
with your smile so tender
My heart was captured
my soul surrendered
I'd spend a lifetime
waiting for the right time
Now that your near
the time is here at last.

It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
My love won't wait.

Just like a willow
we would cry an ocean
If we lost true love
and sweet devotion
Your lips excite me
let your arms invite me
For who knows when
we'll meet again this way

It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
My love won't wait
it's now or never
My love won't wait.

Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time
I hear this sound:
"Here he comes. That's Cathy's clown."

I've gotta stand tall
You know a man can't crawl
But when he knows you're tellin' lies
And he hears them passing' by
He's not a man at all

Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time
I hear this sound:
"Here he comes. That's Cathy's clown."

When you see me shed a tear
And you know that it's sincere
Don't you think it's kind of sad
That you're treating me so bad
Or don't you even care?

Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time
I hear this sound:
"Here he comes.
That's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown."
Thank you, thank you ladies and gentlemen
Thank you, we'd like to do something for you now
We haven't heard a girl sing it and since it's so popular
We'd like to try and do it for you
We hope we remember all the words

Oh the shark has pearly teeth, dear
And he shows them, pearly white
Just a jack knife has Macheath, dear
And he keeps it out of sight

Oh the shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves though, wears Macheath dear
So there's not, not a trace of red

On a Sunday, Sunday morning lies a body, oozin' life
Someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Tell me could it be, could it be, could it be
Mack the Knife?

Oh what's the next chorus, to this song, now
This is the one, now I don't know
But it was a swinging tune and it's a hit tune
So we tried to do Mack the Knife

Ah, Louis Miller, oh, something about cash
Yeah, Miller, he was spending that trash
And Macheath dear, he spends like a sailor
Tell me, tell me, tell me could that boy do, something rash?

Oh Bobby Darin and Louis Armstrong
They made a record, oh but they did
And now Ella, Ella, and her fellas
We're making a wreck, what a wreck of Mack the Knife

Oh Snookie Taudry, bah bah bah nop do bo de do
Bah bah bah nop do bo de do
Just a jack knife has Macheath, dear
And do bo bo bah bah bah nop do bo de do

So, you've heard it, yes, we've swung it
And we tried to, yes, we sung it
You won't recognize it, it's a surprise hit
This tune, called Mack the Knife

And so we leave you, in Berlin town
Yes, we've swung old Mack, we've swung old Mack in town
For the Darin fans and for the Louis Armstrong fans, too
We told you look out, look out, look out old Macheath's back in town
I'm just a lonely boy, lonely and blue
I'm all alone with nothin' to do
I've got everything you could think of
But all I want is someone to love

Someone, yes, someone to love, someone to kiss
Someone to hold at a moment like this
I'd like to hear somebody say
"I'll give you my love each night and day"

I'm just a lonely boy, lonely and blue
I'm all alone with nothin' to do
I've got everything you could think of
But all I want is someone to love

Somebody, somebody, somebody, please send her to me
I'll make her happy, just wait and see
I prayed so hard to the heavens above
That I'm gonna find someone to love

I'm just a lonely boy, lonely and blue
I'm all alone with nothin' to do
I've got everything you could think of
Hey baby, I ain't askin' much of you
No no no no no no no no, baby
I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do

Don't be a stingy little mama
You're 'bout to starve me half to death
Well, you can spare a kiss or two
And still have plenty left

No no no, baby
I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do
That's right

You're just a natural born beehive
Filled with honey to the top
But I ain't greedy, baby
All I want is all you got

No no no, baby
I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do
That's right

I got wishbone in my pocket
I got a rabbit's foot 'round my wrist
You know I'd have all the things my lucky charms could bring
If you'd give me just one sweet kiss

No no no no no no no, baby
I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a hunk o' hunk o' hunk o' love will do
That's right

Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do
That's right
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do
That's right
Just a big-a big-a big-a
I used to play around with hearts
that hastened at my call,
But when I met that little girl
I knew that I would fall.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh.

She played around and teased me
with her carefree devil eyes,
She'd hold me close and kiss me
but her heart was full of lies.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh.

She told me how she cared for me
and that we'd never part,
And so for the very first time
I gave away my heart.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh.

The next day she was gone
and I knew she'd lied to me,
She left me with a broken heart
and won her victory.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh.

I'd played this game with other hearts
but I never thought I'd see,
The day that someone else would play
love's foolish game with me.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh.

And we're in trouble deep

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, what are we gonna tell your Mama

Every man has got to have a party doll,

On a day like today
We passed the time away
Writing love letters in the sand

How you laughed when I cried
Each time I saw the tide
Take our love letters from the sand

You made a vow that you would ever be true
But somehow that vow meant nothing to you

Now my broken heart aches
With every wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand
(whistle)
Now my broken heart aches
With every wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Number forty-seven said to number three
you the cutest jailbird i ever did see
i sure would be delighted with your company
come on and do the jailhouse rock with mw

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock
Rock, rock, r...

Sad Sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin' all alone
The warden said,"Hey, buddy, don't you be no squareIf you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Shifty Henry said to Bugs,"For heaven's sakeNo one's looking, now's our chance to make a break"
Bugsy turned to shifty and he said,"Nix nixI wanna stick around a while and get my kicks"

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock

(honeycomb)
Well it's a darn good life
and it's kinda funny
how the lord made the bee
and the bee made the honey
and the honeybee lookin' for a home
and they called it honeycomb
and they roamed the world and they gathered all

of the honeycomb into one sweet ball
and the honeycomb from a million trips
made my baby's lips
Oh, honeycomb, won't you be my baby
well, honeycomb, be my own
got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
and made a walkin' talkin' honeycomb
well, honeycomb, won't you be my baby

well, honeycomb, be my own
what a darn good life
when you got a wife like honeycomb
(honeycomb)
And the lord said now that i made a bee
i'm gonna look all around for a green, green tree
and he made a little tree and i guess you heard
oh, then well he made a little bird
and they waited all around till the end of spring

gettin' every note that the birdie'd sing
and they put 'em all into one sweet tome
for my honeycomb
Oh, honeycomb, won't you be my baby
well, honeycomb, be my own
got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
and made a walkin' talkin' honeycomb
well, honeycomb, won't you be my baby

well, honeycomb, be my own
what a darn good life
when you got a wife like honeycomb
(honeycomb)
And the lord says now that i made a bird
i'm gonna look all round for a little ol' word
that sounds about sweet like "turtledove"
and i guess i'm gonna call it "love"
and he roamed the world lookin' everywhere
gettin' love from here, love from there
and he put it all in a little ol' part

of my baby's heart
Oh, honeycomb, won't you be my baby
well, honeycomb, be my own
got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
and made a walkin' talkin' honeycomb
well, honeycomb, won't you be my baby
well, honeycomb, be my own
what a darn good life
when you got a wife like honeycomb
(honeycomb)
April love is for the very young
Every stars a wishing star that shines for you
April love is all the seven wonders
One little kiss can tell you this is true

Sometimes an april day will suddenly bring showers
Rain to grow the flowers for her first bouquet
But april love can slip right through your fingers
So if she's the one don't let her run away

Sometimes an april day will suddenly bring showers
Rain to grow the flowers for her first bouquet
But april love can slip right through your fingers
So if she's the one don't let her run away
When the twilight is gone and no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone you come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay, while I pray

My prayer is to linger with you
At the end of the day in a dream that's divine
My prayer is a rapture in blue
With the world far away and your lips close to mine

Tonight while our hearts are aglow
Oh tell me the words that I'm longing to know

My prayer and the answer you give
May they still be the same for as long as we live
That you'll always be there at the end of my prayer
Sweet, sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me

Take one fresh and tender kiss
Add one stolen night of bliss
One girl, one boy
Some grief, some joy

Memories are made of this

Don't forget a small moonbeam
Fold in lightly with a dream
Your lips and mine
Two sips of wine

Memories are made of this

Then add the wedding bells
One house where lovers dwell
Three little kids for the flavor

Stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays
These are the dreams you'll savor

With his blessings from above
Serve it generously with love
One man, one wife
One love through life

Memories are made of this
Memories are made of this

The future looks bright ahead

It's down at the end of lonely street
At Heartbreak Hotel

I've been so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
Well, I'm so lonely I could die

Oh, although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom

They've been so lonely
Well, they're so lonely
Well, they're so lonely they could die

Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well, they been so long on lonely street
They never ever look back

And it's so lonely, baby
And it's so lonely
Well, they're so lonely they could die

Well, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street
To Heartbreak Hotel

You'll be so lonely
You're gonna be lonely
You'll be so lonely you could die
The Ballad of Davy Crockett
Bill Hayes

From _Davy Crockett_

Born on a mountain top in Tennessee
greenest state in the land of the free
raised in the woods so he knew ev'ry tree
kilt him a b'ar when he was only three
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier!

In eighteen thirteen the Creeks uprose
addin' redskin arrows to the country's woes
Now, Injun fightin' is somethin' he knows,
so he shoulders his rifle an' off he goes
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

Off through the woods he's a marchin' along
makin' up yarns an' a singin' a song
itchin' fer fightin' an' rightin' a wrong
he's ringy as a b'ar an' twict as strong
Davy, Davy Crockett, the buckskin buccaneer!

Andy Jackson is our gen'ral's name
his reg'lar soldiers we'll put to shame
Them redskin varmints us Volunteers'll tame
'cause we got the guns with the sure-fire aim
Davy, Davy Crockett, the champion of us all!

Headed back to war from the ol' home place
but Red Stick was leadin' a merry chase
fightin' an' burnin' at a devil's pace
south to the swamps on the Florida Trace
Davy, Davy Crockett, trackin' the redskins down!

Fought single-handed through the Injun War
till the Creeks was whipped an' peace was in store
An' while he was handlin' this risky chore
made hisself a legend for evermore
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier!

He give his word an' he give his hand
that his Injun friends could keep their land
An' the rest of his life he took the stand
that justice was due every redskin band
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his promise dear!

Home fer the winter with his family
happy as squirrels in the ol' gum tree
bein' the father he wanted to be
close to his boys as the pod an' the pea
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his young'uns dear!

But the ice went out an' the warm winds came
an' the meltin' snow showed tracks of game
An' the flowers of Spring filled the woods with flame
an' all of a sudden life got too tame
Davy, Davy Crockett, headin' on West again!

Off through the woods we're ridin' along
makin' up yarns an' singin' a song
He's ringy as a b'ar an' twict as strong
an' knows he's right 'cause he ain' often wrong
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

Lookin' fer a place where the air smells clean
where the trees is tall an' the grass is green
where the fish is fat in an untouched stream
an' the teemin' woods is a hunter's dream
Davy, Davy Crockett, lookin' fer Paradise!

Now he's lost his love an' his grief was gall
in his heart he wanted to leave it all
an' lose himself in the forests tall
but he answered instead his country's call
Davy, Davy Crockett, beginnin' his campaign!

Needin' his help they didn't vote blind
They put in Davy 'cause he was their kind
sent up to Nashville the best they could find
a fightin' spirit an' a thinkin' mind
Davy, Davy Crockett, choice of the whole frontier!

The votes were counted an' he won hands down
so they sent him off to Washin'ton town
with his best dress suit still his buckskins brown
a livin' legend of growin' renown
Davy, Davy Crockett, the Canebrake Congressman!

He went off to Congress an' served a spell
fixin' up the Govern'ments an' laws as well
took over Washin'ton so we heered tell
an' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear!

Him an' his jokes travelled all through the land
an' his speeches made him friends to beat the band
His politickin' was their favorite brand
an' everyone wanted to shake his hand
Davy, Davy Crockett, helpin' his legend grow!

He knew when he spoke he sounded the knell
of his hopes for White House an' fame as well
But he spoke out strong so hist'ry books tell
an' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear!

When he come home his politickin' done
the western march had just begun
So he packed his gear an' his trusty gun
an' lit out grinnin' to follow the sun
Davy, Davy Crockett, leadin' the pioneer!

He heard of Houston an' Austin so
to the Texas plains he jest had to go
Where freedom was fightin' another foe
an' they needed him at the Alamo
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

His land is biggest an' his land is best
from grassy plains to the mountain crest
He's ahead of us all meetin' the test
followin' his legend into the West
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier!
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

Mr. Sandman (yes) bring us a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come-hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace

Mr Sandman, someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're too old
So please turn on your magic beam
Mr Sandman, bring us, please, please, please
Mr Sandman, bring us a dream
Hearts made of stone
Will never break
For the love you have for them
They just won't take
You can ask them please
Please please please break
And all of your love
Is there to take

Yes, hearts of stone
Will cause you pain
Although you love them
They'll stop you just the same
You can ask them please
Please please please break
And all of your love
Is there to take

But they'll say no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Everybody knows
I thought you knew
Hearts made of stone

Yes, hearts of stone
Will cause you pain
Although you love them
They'll stop you just the same
You can ask them please
Please please please break
And all of your love
Is there to take

But they'll say no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Everybody knows
I thought you knew
Hearts made of stone
