Doesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee 
Never never will I feel discouraged 
Cause our love's no mystery 
Demonstrating love and affection 
That you give so openly yeah 
I like the way ya make me about you baby 
Want the whole wide world to see 
Whoa whoa, you got the best of my love 
Whoa whoa, you got the best of my love 
Whoa whoa, you got the best of my love
